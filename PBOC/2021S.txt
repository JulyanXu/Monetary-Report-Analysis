Part 1. Money and Credit Analysis  Starting from 2021, under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with  Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, following the guidelines of the Fifth Plenary  Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the Central Economic Work  Conference, and implementing the requirements set forth in the Report on the Work of  the Government, the People's Bank of China (PBC) pursued a sound monetary policy  which is flexible, targeted, reasonable, and appropriate. Money, credit, and aggregate  financing to the real economy gained reasonable growth. Overall financing costs  remained stable, albeit with a slight decline. Financial support for the real economy,  key areas, and weak links was further strengthened. All this buttressed stable  performance of the economy with good momentum.  I. Liquidity in the banking system was adequate at a reasonable level  In Q2 2021, the PBC pursued a sound monetary policy that is flexible, targeted,  reasonable, and appropriate. It made scientific judgments about macroeconomic  conditions and implemented the concept of a cross-cycle design. By comprehensively  using multiple policy tools, such as the Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) and open  market operations (OMOs), to inject liquidity, and conducting these operations in a  more forward-looking, flexible, and effective manner, the PBC maintained adequate  liquidity in the banking system at a reasonable level. In the meantime, the PBC  strengthened direct communications with market entities in many ways to stabilize  market expectations, and it steadily released policy rate signals. Market interest rates  were guided to move around the OMO rates, further strengthening the stability of  interest rates. On July 15, the PBC reduced the required reserve ratio (RRR) by 0.5  percentage points, optimizing the capital structure of financial institutions through  liquidity management. The PBC proactively took into consideration factors, such as the  peak tax period, the maturity of the MLF, and the accelerated issuance of local  government bonds, and placed an emphasis on balancing demand and supply of market  funds. Thus, the short, medium, and long-term liquidity supply was kept adequate at a  reasonable level, basically in line with market demand. At end-June, the excess reserve  ratio of financial institutions registered 1.2 percent, down 0.4 percentage points from  the corresponding period of 2020.  II. Lending by financial institutions grew reasonably, with the lending rates at  historically low levels  Credits provide solid support for the real economy. During the COVID-19 pandemic,  there was an increase in enterprises鈥� demand for additional financing, which was fully  satisfied by financial institutions. This pushed up the base of financial data in H1 2020.  Despite a high base, financial data still witnessed fairly large year-on-year growth in  H1 2021, with the normal financing demands of enterprises satisfied and support for  the real economy steady. At end-June, outstanding loans issued by financial institutions  in domestic and foreign currencies grew 11.9 percent year on year to RMB191.6 trillion,  increasing RMB13.2 trillion from the beginning of 2021 and RMB500.2 billion more  than the increase during the corresponding period of 2020, respectively. Outstanding  RMB-denominated loans grew 12.3 percent year on year to RMB185.5 trillion, up  RMB12.8 trillion from the beginning of 2021 and an increase that was RMB667.7  billion larger than that during the corresponding period of 2020.  With the credit structure continuously being improved, key areas and weak links, such as the manufacturing sector and micro and small businesses (MSBs), received targeted  support. At end-June, medium and long-term loans to enterprises and public entities  grew by RMB6.6 trillion from the beginning of the year, a year-on-year acceleration of  RMB1.8 trillion. Medium and long-term loans to the manufacturing sector increased  by 41.6 percent, marking the fourth consecutive month of growth over 40 percent. In  particular, the high-tech manufacturing sector witnessed a year-on-year increase of 46.3  percent. Outstanding inclusive loans to MSBs grew by 31 percent year on year to  RMB17.7 trillion, 18.7 percentage points higher than that of total loans during the same  period. These loans supported 38.3 million MSBs, rising 29.2 percent year on year. The weighted average interest rates on loans hit a record low. In 2021, the PBC  continued to release the potential of the loan prime rate (LPR) reform, guided actual  lending rates to go down amidst stability, and encouraged the financial sector to cut  profits in favor of the real economy. In the meantime, the PBC optimized regulation  over deposit rates and adjusted the self-disciplinary ceiling for deposit rates, leading to  a decline in the borrowing costs of banks. In June, the one-year LPR and the over-five year LPR stood at 3.85 percent and 4.65 percent, respectively, on par with those in  December 2020. The weighted average lending rate recorded 4.93 percent in June,  sinking to a new low. In particular, the weighted average interest rate on ordinary loans  registered 5.20 percent, down 0.06 percentage point year on year, hitting a record low.  The weighted average corporate lending rate fell by 0.06 percentage point year on year  to 4.58 percent, reaching historically low levels. This indicates that financial support  for the real economy continues to yield positive results.  In June, the share of ordinary loans with rates above, at, or below the LPR registered  67.67 percent, 8.07 percent, and 24.25 percent, respectively.  Interest rates on foreign-currency deposits and loans declined slightly. In June, the  weighted average interest rates on demand and large-value USD-denominated deposits  with maturities within 3 months registered 0.10 percent and 0.43 percent, down 0.06  and 0.16 percentage point from December 2020, respectively. The weighted average  interest rates on USD-denominated loans with maturities within 3 months and with  maturities between 3 months (including 3 months) and 6 months registered 1.15 percent  and 0.99 percent, down 0.07 percentage points and 0.37 percentage points from  December 2020, respectively.  Deposits grew steadily. At end-June, outstanding deposits in domestic and foreign  currencies in all financial institutions increased 9.5 percent year on year to RMB233.2  trillion, up RMB14.8 trillion from the beginning of 2021 and an acceleration of  RMB50.1 billion. Outstanding RMB deposits grew 9.2 percent year on year to  RMB226.7 trillion, an increase of RMB14 trillion from the beginning of the year and a  deceleration of RMB506.4 billion. Outstanding deposits in foreign currencies stood at  USD1 trillion, an increase of USD129.7 billion from the beginning of 2021 and an  acceleration of USD109.1 billion. This was against the backdrop of China leading the  global economic recovery and a widened trade surplus. III. Broad money supply and aggregate financing to the real economy displayed  appropriate growth  Outstanding M2 recorded RMB231.8 trillion at end-June, increasing 8.6 percent year  on year, and thus maintaining strong support for the real economy. Outstanding M1 and  M0 registered RMB63.7 trillion and RMB8.4 trillion, respectively, increasing 5.5  percent and 6.2 percent year on year. H1 2021 witnessed a net cash injection of RMB3.2  billion, which is RMB223.8 billion less than that in the same period of the previous  year.  According to preliminary statistics, outstanding aggregate financing to the real  economy (AFRE) at end-June reached over RMB300 trillion, recording RMB301.56  trillion specifically. Year-on-year growth registered 11 percent, decelerating 2.3  percentage points compared to the growth recorded at end-2020. The AFRE increment  in H1 2021 totaled RMB17.74 trillion, dropping RMB3.13 trillion year on year. It  shows the following characteristics: first, RMB-denominated loans recorded a larger  year-on-year increase. Second, trust loans and undiscounted bankers鈥� acceptances  recorded a significantly larger year-on-year drop. Third, corporate bonds showed a  year-on-year drop in growth, while domestic equity financing of non-financial  companies exhibited a year-on-year increase. Fourth, government bonds recorded a  significantly smaller year-on-year increase. Fifth, asset-backed securities of depository  institutions showed a larger year-on-year increase. Box 1 A Proper Understanding of Money and Inflation  There are views that the relationship between money and inflation is no longer  functional because in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, the prolonged over issuance of money in the major advanced economies did not lead to high inflation.  Consequently, central bank purchasing of assets as a way to expand money supply has  become the elixir that can spur the economy without causing high inflation. In this  respect, it is necessary to take a proper view of the difference between the quantitative  easing (QE) policies unveiled following the 2008 global financial crisis and those  policies adopted in response to the 2020 pandemic, and correctly understand the  relationship between money and inflation.  First, the QE policy that focuses on increasing base money, under which real  money growth is limited. For nearly a decade following the 2008 global financial crisis,  various factors had contributed to low inflation in the major advanced economies, such  as globalization and technological development on the supply side, the aging population,  debt overdrafts, and wealth polarization on the demand side. From a monetary  perspective, although central banks in the US, Europe, and Japan adopted QE policies  and significantly expanded their balance sheets from end-Q3 2008 to end-2017 to  increase base money, average annual growth of money supply (broad money) in these  regions were only 6.5 percent, 2.8 percent, and 2.7 percent, respectively, which roughly  matched their average nominal GDP growth of 3.1 percent, 1.8 percent, and 0.4 percent  during the same period. This is the fundamental reason that the advanced economies  did not experience a significant inflation. It should be noted that in a modern banking and credit money system, the direct money  creators are banks rather than the central bank, and QE policies, including central bank  purchases of government bonds, do not necessarily drive money growth. Base money  is different from money in that it mainly serves the purpose of reserve requirements in  the banking system and payment clearing needs. Therefore, it is money that is used in  circulation by economic entities, and it is created by banks through asset expansions,  such as bank loans. Thus, in the long term, it is money and not base money that is  closely related to inflation. After the 2008 crisis, central bank purchases of government  bonds in the US and other advanced economies led to higher excess reserves in the  banking system. But as central bank purchases mainly included existing government  bonds in the market, there were no significant monetized deficits. In addition, the  banking system was not enthusiastic about creating money through bank loans, which  kept the corresponding excess reserves within the banking system and thus did not  cause significant growth of money. From end-August 2008 before the crisis to end-  2017, the balance sheets of the central banks in the US, Europe, and Japan expanded  375 percent, 209 percent, and 375 percent, respectively, while money supply during the  same period only increased 80 percent, 30 percent, and 27 percent, far lower than the  expansion rates of the central bank balance sheets.  Second, QE policies adopted to increase money in coordination with fiscal policies,  which significantly fueled the global inflation in 2021. After the outbreak of the  pandemic in 2020, to address its impact and support an economic recovery, the major  advanced economies adopted a policy combination of an excessively loose monetary  policy and a massive fiscal stimulus, thereby driving money growth through  government-led efforts. From the perspective of the underlying mechanism: the central  bank buys government bonds and increases excess reserves, which are turned into fiscal  deposits through new issues of government bonds; fiscal deposits are then turned into  deposits of economic entities through fiscal spending of households and businesses.  The combinations of these interwoven operations cause money to grow. In 2020, the  US Fed purchased about 52 percent of newly issued Treasury bonds, and the money  supply generated from this support to fiscal spending constituted 61 percent of M2  growth in the US. As of end-2020, money supply in the US, Europe, and Japan recorded  year-on-year growth of 24.9 percent, 12.3 percent, and 7.6 percent, while nominal GDP  growth registered -2.3 percent, -5 percent, and -4 percent, respectively. Money growth  was highly inconsistent with nominal GDP growth. In terms of consumer price  movements, inflation was most serious in the US, and the gap between monetary  expansion and nominal GDP growth was also the widest. The US CPI in June reached  a 13-year high of 5.4 percent, up 4 percentage points from end-2020. Meanwhile, the  CPI in Europe and Japan were up 2.2 and 1.4 percentage points, respectively, from end-  2020. It should also be noted that government-led growth of broad money has  undesirable consequences, such as disrupting financial discipline, damaging the ability  of the banking system to create money in a market-oriented manner, and a lack of  vitality in the economy.  In general, the relationship between money and inflation is unchanged, and a massive  over-issuance of money will inevitably intensify inflation. Therefore, the key to keeping  inflation stable is to maintain sound management of money. Current inflation pressures  in China are generally contained, which can be attributed to the fact that since last May  the growth of money supply in China has been returning to its normal level at a faster  pace than that in other large economies. As of end-June 2021, M2 growth in China  registered 8.6 percent, basically equivalent to its pre-pandemic level and corresponding  to nominal economic growth, thus keeping prices stable from a macro standpoint. Next,  it is necessary that monetary policy continue to prioritize stability. A sound monetary  policy should be flexible, targeted, reasonable, and appropriate. The PBC will keep the  growth of money supply and the AFRE generally in line with nominal economic growth,  and it will stick to its role as a fund provider that is separate from the fiscal authorities  so as to fundamentally ensure the overall stability of consumer prices.  IV. The RMB exchange rate remained basically stable at an adaptive and  equilibrium level  Since the beginning of 2021, cross-border capital flows and foreign-exchange supply and demand have been basically in equilibrium. Market expectations have been  generally stable. Based on market supply and demand, the RMB exchange rate moved  in both directions and remained basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. In  H1, the RMB appreciated to some extent against a basket of currencies. At end-June,  the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) RMB exchange rate index and the  RMB exchange rate index based on the special drawing rights (SDRs) basket closed at  98.00 and 96.77, respectively, up 3.3 percent and 2.7 percent from end-2020. According  to calculations by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), as of end-June 2021,  the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and the real effective exchange rate (REER)  of the RMB have appreciated 2.9 percent and 0.3 percent since end-2020, and 41.7  percent and 51.9 percent since the reform of the exchange rate formation mechanism  that began in 2005. The RMB appreciated against the US dollar in H1. At end-June, the  central parity of the RMB against the US dollar was 6.4601, appreciating 1.0 percent  from end-2020 and 28.1 percent on a cumulative basis since the reform of the exchange  rate formation mechanism that began in 2005. In H1, the annualized volatility rate of  the RMB against the US dollar was 3.5 percent.  Cross-border RMB settlements in H1 totaled RMB17.6 trillion, increasing 39 percent  year on year. In particular, RMB receipts and payments registered RMB8.9 trillion and  RMB8.6 trillion, respectively. Cross-border RMB settlements under the current account  grew by 17 percent year on year to RMB3.6 trillion, among which RMB settlements of  trade in goods registered RMB2.7 trillion, whereas RMB settlements of trade in  services and other items registered RMB952.69 billion. Cross-border RMB settlements  under the capital account posted RMB14 trillion, increasing 46 percent year on year. In Q2 2021, the PBC resolutely implemented the decisions and arrangements made by  the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and kept the sound monetary policy  flexible and targeted, and at a reasonable and appropriate level. The PBC conducted  open market operations (OMOs) in a targeted manner, advanced the market-based  reforms of interest rates and exchange rates, further leveraged the targeted guidance  role of structural monetary policy instruments, and intensified policy support to areas  that call for long-term support, such as scientific and technological innovations, micro  and small businesses (MSBs), green development, and manufacturing, thus fostering a  favorable monetary and financial environment for high-quality economic development.  I. Conducting open market operations  Conducting open market operations in a flexible manner. The PBC fully analyzed  market developments in terms of the supply and demand of funds, and conducted  successive open market operations daily to enhance operational flexibility, preciseness,  and effectiveness, to avoid both liquidity strains and excessive idle funds arising from  oversupply and to maintain liquidity within the banking system at a proper and adequate  level that was neither too tight nor loose, with the provision of medium and long-term  liquidity via monetary policy instruments such as the Medium-term Lending Facility  (MLF) as the basis. The central bank鈥檚 cross-cyclical arrangements reduced liquidity  fluctuations, stabilized market expectations, lowered the demand for precautionary  funds, and enhanced the efficiency of its liquidity operations. In late June, the PBC  properly scaled up its open market reverse repurchase operations (repos) to satisfy the  market鈥檚 short-term funding needs at the end of the six-month period and to maintain  money-market stability at the end of the first half-year.  Guiding market rates to move around central bank policy rates. In Q2 2021, both  the rates paid on the MLF and the reverse repos remained unchanged. Meanwhile, the  PBC sent short-term policy rate signals through daily operations of 7-day reverse repos,  and guided money-market rates to move around the OMO rates. As a result, the  fluctuation of interest rates declined further, market expectations became more stable,  and OMO rates played a strengthened role as the pivotal short-term rates. In Q2 2021,  the weighted average rate on 7-day repos between depository institutions in the  interbank market (DR007) averaged 2.16 percent, close to the central bank鈥檚 7-day  reverse repo rate. The money-market rates at end-Q2 remained stable, and the  deviations from the OMO rates sharply narrowed compared to those in previous years.  Continuously conducting central bank bill swap (CBS) operations. In Q2 2021, the  PBC conducted CBS operations three times, with the total amount registering RMB15  billion. The maturity of each operation was three months, at a fixed rate of 0.10 percent.  Since the beginning of 2021, the PBC has conducted CBS operations regularly on a  monthly basis, and these operations have played a positive role in boosting liquidity in  the secondary market of bank-issued perpetual bonds and in supporting the issuance of  perpetual bonds to replenish capital by banks, especially by small and medium-sized  banks.  Issuing central bank bills in Hong Kong on a regular basis. In Q2 2021, the PBC  issued three batches of RMB-denominated central bank bills in Hong Kong, totaling  RMB30 billion. Specifically, the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year bills registered RMB10  billion, RMB5 billion, and RMB15 billion, respectively. In H1 2021, the issuance of  six batches of RMB-denominated central bank bills totaled RMB60 billion, which  enriched the RMB investment products and the RMB liquidity management tools in the  Hong Kong market, propelled both domestic and overseas market entities to issue  RMB-denominated bonds and to conduct RMB business in the offshore market, and  helped promote the sustainable and sound development of the offshore RMB market.  In H1 2021, offshore RMB bond issuances, excluding RMB-denominated central bank  bills issued in Hong Kong, registered roughly RMB100 billion, a year-on-year increase  of 80 percent. Moreover, the RMB offshore market saw increasingly brisker  transactions Box 2 The Management of Monetary Policy Expectations Attained Notable  Achievements  Developing a mechanism for the management of monetary policy expectations is an  important step to improve a modern monetary policy framework. The increasingly rule based and transparent monetary policy operations as well as the establishment of an  institutionalized monetary policy communications mechanism facilitate effective  management and guidance of public expectations, and they boost the consistency  between market entities and policy goals, thereby stabilizing the macro economy. The  14th Five-year Plan for Economic and Social Development and the Long-range  Objectives through the Year 2035 sets out to improve the formulation and  implementation mechanism for macro policies and to attach importance to the  management and guidance of expectations. In recent years, when formulating and  implementing monetary policies, the PBC has continued to improve expectation  management and it has developed a scientific and effective mechanism for the  management and guidance of monetary policy expectations, thus enhancing the central  bank鈥檚 transparency and accountability.  Enhancing a modern monetary policy framework and elevating monetary policy  transparency. Under a modern monetary policy framework, the PBC clarified its  intermediary target that the growth of money supply and of aggregate financing to the  real economy (AFRE) roughly matched nominal economic growth, clarifying how  monetary policy objectives should be anchored. The PBC improved the policy rates  system with open market operation (OMO) rates and the MLF rates serving as short  and medium-term policy rates respectively and it targeted these two rates in operations,  enabling institutions and the public to observe the monetary policy orientation. The  PBC deepened the loan prime rate (LPR) reform and improved the formation and  transmission mechanism of market-based rates from policy rates to the LPR and to  lending rates, which significantly enhanced policy transmission efficiency and greatly  improved the central bank鈥檚 efficiency in information transmission.  Improving the regular monetary policy communication mechanism and fostering stable  market expectations. The PBC gradually fixed the frequency of expectations  management as it conducted successive daily open market operations and MLF  operations at a fixed time in the middle of each month with the release of operation  arrangements in advance to stabilize market expectations; the PBC illustrated its  monetary policy stance and released monetary policy signals in each of the 12 months,  as in each quarter it held a press briefing on financial statistics in the first month,  released the China Monetary Policy Report in the second month, and held a quarterly  meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee and released an announcement in the third  month; the PBC held working conferences early and mid-year and issued press releases;  the PBC released the Annual Report of the PBC and the Report of China鈥檚 Regional  Financial Development annually to objectively reflect the effects of its monetary  policies.  Diversifying the methods used in monetary policy communications and effectively  enhancing the efficiency of communications with the public. The PBC responded to  market concerns through a wide range of methods, including attending  regular State Council policy briefings and press conferences of the State Council  Information Office, releasing answers to press questions regarding certain policies and  the transcripts of press conferences (briefings), participating in interviews with  domestic and foreign media, and publishing signed articles; the PBC reported its  judgments about the economic and financial situation and about future targeted  approaches to the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee of the National People鈥檚  Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),  and held consultative meetings with financial experts and industry associations to  introduce the work concerning monetary policies, to exchange ideas, and to establish a  two-way interaction mechanism; the PBC effectively leveraged the combined strength  of its new media matrix, including its WeChat account and Weibo and its Chinese and  English websites, to create a diversified three-dimensional system for expectations  management and guidance.  The effective management of monetary policy expectations primarily lies in the PBC  鈥減racticing what it preaches.鈥� The mutual verification and coordination between the  PBC鈥檚 policy operations and external communications reinforces the accountability of  monetary policies. In terms of liquidity expectations from the market, the PBC guided  financial institutions to focus on the level of interest rates instead of focusing too much  on the amount of liquidity, and the central bank conducts OMOs each day to send short term policy rate signals. Since the beginning of 2021, the liquidity and money-market  rates have remained stable, with no large fluctuations at the end of each month and at  the end of each quarter, and the deviation of the DR007 in relation to the OMO rates on  the 7-day reverse repos remained low compared with the same period in recent years,  thus providing a stable environment for liquidity management by financial institutions  and for stabilizing market expectations. Stable market expectations further reduced  precautionary liquidity demands and enhanced liquidity stability.  On balance, the management of monetary policy expectations scored notable  achievements as the monetary policy framework was more open and straightforward,  monetary policy operations became more rule-based and transparent, monetary policy  communications were more regular and institutionalized, the efficiency of  communications between the PBC and the public improved significantly, and the  efficiency of monetary policy transmissions was enhanced. In the next stage, the PBC  will continue to uphold the people-centered philosophy of governance, focus on  enhancing the transparency of the monetary policy framework, maintain the efficiency  and fairness of expectations management, further improve equity in access to  information by the public, and bolster the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission  and the accountability of the central bank.  II. Timely conducting Standing Lending Facility and Medium-term Lending  Facility operations  Well-timed MLF operations were conducted. To ensure an appropriate supply of  medium and long-term liquidity and to give play to the signaling and guiding functions  of the medium-term policy rates, the PBC conducted a total of RMB1.25 trillion of  MLF operations in H1, all with a maturity of one year and an interest rate of 2.95  percent. The MLF operations conducted in Q2 totaled RMB450 billion. At end-June,  the outstanding MLF registered RMB5.40 trillion, RMB250 billion more than that at  the beginning of 2021.  Standing Lending Facility (SLF) operations were conducted in a timely manner.  The demand for short-term liquidity by locally incorporated financial institutions was  met in the full amount. In H1, the PBC conducted a total of RMB59.1 billion in SLF  operations, of which operations in Q2 registered RMB11.6 billion and the balance of  such operations at end-June posted RMB8.6 billion. The SLF rate played its role as the  ceiling of the interest rate corridor, and it safeguarded the smooth operation of the  money market. At end-June, the overnight, 7-day, and 1-month SLF rates stood at 3.05  percent, 3.20 percent, and 3.55 percent, respectively, on par with the rates at the end of  the previous quarter. In May 2021, the PBC issued the Notice on Issues Concerning  Improvements in SLF Management (YinFa No.135 [2021]) to strengthen SLF  management. The efficiency of SLF operations improved through a systemic  transformation that enabled small and medium financial institutions to borrow SLF in  the form delivery versus payment (DVP).  .  III. Adjusting the required reserve ratio for financial institutions  The foreign exchange required reserve ratio was raised for financial institutions  and foreign exchange liquidity management of financial institutions was enhanced.  The PBC decided to raise the foreign exchange required reserve ratio by two percentage  points, from 5 percent to 7 percent, effective on June 15, 2021, soaking up foreign  exchange liquidity in the amount of over USD 20 billion.  The required reserve ratio for financial institutions was lowered by 0.5 percentage  points in an attempt to support the real economy and ensure that costs of overall  financing drop steadily. The PBC decided to reduce the required reserve ratio by 0.5  percentage point, effective on July 15 (not applicable to financial institutions that had  already carried a required reserve ratio of 5 percent), releasing about RMB 1 trillion of  long-term funds. After this round of RRR cuts, the weighted average required reserve  ratio for financial institutions stood at 8.9 percent. This RRR reduction is a conventional  operation following normalization of monetary policies, aimed at improving the  funding structure of financial institutions and enhancing their capability to allocate  funds. First, by keeping adequate liquidity at a reasonable level, the PBC created a  favorable monetary and financial environment for high-quality development and  supply-side structural reform. Second, by optimizing the financing structure of financial  institutions, the PBC effectively expanded the sources of long-term stable funding for  financial institutions to support the real economy and guided these institutions to  actively use the funds released from the RRR reduction to boost support for MSBs.  Third, the RRR reduction lowered the funding costs of financial institutions by  approximately RMB13 billion per year, which further reduced overall social financing  costs through the transmission of financial institutions.  IV. Further improving the macro-prudential management framework  The role of the macro-prudential assessment (MPA) was effectively brought into  play to optimize the credit structure and to promote the supply-side structural  reform of the financial sector. In H1 2021, in line with the requirements for the key  tasks set at the Central Economic Work Conference, the PBC further improved the  MPA and attached more importance to the assessment requirements to support key  areas and weak links. It dynamically adjusted the relevant assessment indicators in an  attempt to guide financial institutions to step up support to provide medium and long term financing to inclusive MSBs and the manufacturing sector.  The regulatory framework for systemically important financial institutions was  improved. In order to implement the requirements established by the Guiding Opinions  on Improving Supervision of Systemically Important Financial Institutions, the PBC  issued supporting regulations in line with the Measures for Assessments of Systemically  Important Banks (SIBs). The PBC, jointly with the CBIRC, drafted the Additional  Regulatory Rules for Systemically Important Banks (Trial) (Exposure Draft)  (hereinafter referred to as the Rules), and solicited public opinion starting from April 2.  The Rules specify additional regulatory requirements on SIBs in terms of an indicator  system, recovery and resolution schemes, and prudential regulatory measures, and they urge the SIBs to reduce systemic risks and to enhance their resilience and bail-in  capabilities.  V. Actively leveraging the role of structural monetary policy instruments  The PBC actively used central bank lending to support rural development, central  bank lending for MSBs, central bank discounts, and other tools to guide financial  institutions to step up support for areas such as MSBs, private firms, agriculture,  rural areas, and rural people as well as for poverty alleviation. The role of central  bank lending was further brought into play to provide targeted liquidity and to serve as  positive incentives. Central bank lending to support rural development and central bank  lending for MSBs was used to guide locally incorporated financial institutions to  expand the supply of credit for rural revitalization. Central bank lending for poverty  alleviation was rolled over according to the current regulations so as to underpin and  consolidate the achievements of poverty eradication. Coordinated development of the  regional economy and finance was promoted with a newly added quota of RMB200  billion of central bank lending to ten provinces with slow credit growth. Locally  incorporated financial institutions were guided to step up policy support for areas such  as agro-related businesses, MSBs, and private enterprises in these ten provinces. As of  end-June, outstanding central bank lending to support rural development stood at  RMB465.3 billion. Outstanding central bank lending for MSBs and for poverty  alleviation posted RMB888.2 billion and RMB201.4 billion, respectively. Outstanding  central bank discounts registered RMB592.2 billion. In H1, the PBC made net  withdrawals of PSLs in the amount of RMB142.4 billion from development and policy  banks, with net withdrawals in Q2 totaling RMB101.4 billion and the outstanding PSLs  registering RMB3.0926 trillion at end-June.  Targeted Medium-term Lending Facility (TMLF) operations maturing in Q2 were  rolled over in the form of MLFs. The TMLFs provided a stable and long-term funding  source for financial institutions to expand their credit supply to MSBs and private firms  with preferential interest rates. On April 15, the PBC conducted one-year MLF  operations totaling RMB150 billion, with a rate of 2.95 percent, including the rollover  of TMLFs maturing in April. At end-June, the TMLFs maturing in Q2 were rolled over  in the form of MLFs, with the outstanding TMLFs posting zero.  Highlighting the characteristics of directness and precision, two monetary policy  instruments that directly support the real economy were continuously promoted,  with the aim of bolstering the development of MSMEs. From the introduction of the  policy in June 2020 to end-June 2021, operations of instruments supporting deferred  repayments of inclusive MSB loans were conducted on a monthly basis and provided a  total of RMB14.5 billion in incentive funds to local corporate banks to support  extensions of repayments of the principal of inclusive small and micro enterprise loans.  A total of RMB1.4478 trillion was used to alleviate the pressures on small and micro  enterprises to repay the principal and interest in stages. The support plan for inclusive  unsecured MSB loans operated on a quarterly basis. Cumulative preferential funding of  RMB221.5 billion was used to provide support for the issuance RMB620.4 billion of  unsecured loans to MSBs, thereby effectively alleviating their difficulties to access  financing. From the beginning of 2020 to June 2021, banking institutions nationwide  deferred RMB11.8 trillion of principal and interest repayments totaling RMB11.8  trillion and issued cumulative inclusive unsecured MSB loans totaling RMB6.9 trillion.  In line with the arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council, the PBC promoted the launch of instruments in support of carbon  emissions reductions. According to the requirements set forth in the Report on the  Work of the Government and the decisions of the executive meeting of the State Council,  the PBC launched a structural monetary policy instrument supporting carbon emissions  reductions. Through the provision of low-cost funds for eligible financial institutions,  the PBC supported financial institutions by providing funding at preferential interest  rates to key projects that will significantly reduce carbon emissions. As a structural  monetary policy instrument providing direct support for the real economy, the PBC  supported developments in areas of clean energy, energy savings and environmental  protection, and carbon emissions reduction technology in a precise and direct manner,  and it leveraged more social funding to promote carbon emissions reduction. In line  with market-oriented, law-based, and international principles, the design of the  instrument fully exhibits openness and transparency. With such a 鈥渇easible, calculable,  and verifiable鈥� design, the instrument is precise and direct. Being feasible means that  efforts are made to clearly support key areas that will significantly reduce carbon  emissions, including clean energy, energy savings and environmental protection, and  carbon emissions reduction technology. Being calculable means that financial  institutions can calculate the amount of carbon emissions reductions driven by loans,  and they can disclose the information on carbon emissions reductions, subject to social  supervision. Being verifiable means that third-party professional institutions can be  introduced to verify the authenticity of the information disclosed by financial  institutions so as guarantee their policy effects.  Box 3 The Role of Monetary Policy in Supporting Regional Coordinated  Development  At the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), it was  proposed that the principal challenge facing Chinese society has shifted to the gap  between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people鈥檚 ever-growing needs  for a better life. According to the requirements of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th  CPC Central Committee, coordinated development between urban and rural areas and  among regions should be enhanced notably during the 14th Five-Year Plan. Meanwhile,  the new development concept also places an emphasis on coordinated development. At  present, the economic downturn and financial issues are interconnected in some regions,  with a poor cycle between the economy and finance and fairly slow growth of credit.  In order to promote coordinated regional development, targeted measures that suit local  conditions need to be adopted to increase credit supply to regions with slow credit  growth, thereby helping foster a virtuous circle between the economy and finance.  The PBC attaches great importance to promoting coordinated regional  development. Multiple measures have been adopted and coordinated efforts have  been made to guide all kinds of financial institutions to enhance credit support to  regions with slow credit growth, under the precondition that risks are kept well  under control. First, policy banks are guided to remedy their weaknesses in regional  development. The three policy banks, namely, China Development Bank,  Agricultural Development Bank of China, and Export-Import Bank of China, are  required to guarantee that the proportion of new loans in certain regions to their new  loans in 2021 be no less than that in 2020, and they should strive to raise that proportion.  Second, full play should be given to the national commercial banks, especially the large  state-owned banks, to spearhead their role in credit supply. In line with market-oriented  and law-based principles, and under the precondition of sound risk control, banks are  guided to optimize their internal assessments and incentive measures and to increase  the credit supply in the relevant regions according to local conditions so as to support  coordinated regional development. The Agricultural Bank of China is required to  effectively use the preferential required reserve ratio policy granted for its Finance  Division of Agriculture, Rural Areas, and Rural People and to beef up support for  regions with slow credit growth. The proportion of new loans provided by the Finance  Division of Agriculture, Rural Areas, and Rural People to the relevant regions to all  new loans in 2021 should be higher than that in 2020. Third, local financial institutions  should be fully motivated as the central bank increased the quota of central bank lending  by RMB200 billion to the relevant regions. In addition, under the precondition of  guaranteeing the safety of central bank funds, the requirements have been properly  eased for eligible borrowers. Local financial institutions are guided to step up credit  support for weak links, such as agro-related businesses, MSBs, and private enterprises,  under the precondition of sound risk control.  A series of targeted measures have produced positive results. First, support policies  of central bank lending have been promoted in an orderly manner, achieving notable  results in leveraging the loans of locally incorporated financial institutions in certain  regions. As of end-June 2021, the PBC issued central bank lending in the amount of  RMB160 billion, accomplishing 80 percent of the total quota. In H1 2021, new loans  by locally incorporated financial institutions witnessed a notable increase in certain  regions. Second, policy banks and national commercial banks have actively  implemented policies and have stepped up support for regions with fairly slow credit  growth. The supply of credit has been enhanced to relevant regions through increasing  the allocation of credit resources, optimizing the pricing of internal fund transfers and  capital employment, and implementing differentiated internal assessments and  incentive measures.  In H1 2021, the proportion of new loans in certain regions to all new loans issued by  the three policy banks and the six large state-owned commercial banks witnessed a  year-on-year increase. It is the same case with the Finance Division of Agriculture,  Rural Areas, and Rural People of the Agricultural Bank of China. Overall, the credit  situation has obviously improved in regions with slow credit growth. In certain regions,  both the amount of new RMB loans and the proportion to new loans across the country  saw a year-on-year rise in H1 2021.  Going forward, the PBC will continue to effectively implement all measures and  constantly track and monitor the use of RMB200 billion of central bank lending. Further  support will be given to such provinces by the rapid issuance of central bank lending, a  high ratio of utilization, and active introduction of corresponding measures by the local  governments in an attempt to give full play to the leveraging role of central bank lending.  Various kinds of financial institutions will be guided to continuously enhance credit  support for regions with slow credit growth. Efforts will be made to accelerate  improvements in the financial environment, to smooth the virtuous circle between the  economy and finance, and to guide the shift toward positive expectations, so as to create  a favorable environment for achieving high-quality development in certain regions.  VI. Bringing into play the role of credit policy to guide structural reform  Financial support to keep businesses and employment stable was enhanced. The  Notice on Promoting the Project of Enhancing the Capacity to Provide Financial  Services for Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (Yinfa No. 176 [2021]) was  issued, which established detailed requirements for improving the capacity to provide  financial services for MSMEs and strengthened the building of a long-term mechanism  for 鈥渓ending with confidence, willingness, ability, and professionalism.鈥� A dedicated  project with the theme of 鈥淟ending to Support Small Businesses for Serving the General  Public鈥檚 Livelihood鈥� was launched in a bid to boost financial support for self-employed  businesses and to further improve financial services. At end-June 2021, outstanding  inclusive loans to MSBs grew by 31 percent year on year to RMB17.7 trillion. These  loans supported 38.30 million MSBs, an increase of 29.2 percent year on year.  Effective support was provided to consolidate and expand the achievements of  poverty eradication and to comprehensively promote rural revitalization. The PBC,  jointly with five other departments, released the Opinions on Financial Support for  Consolidating Achievements in the Critical Battle against Poverty and  Comprehensively Promoting Rural Revitalization (Yinfa No. 171 [2021]), which  adjusted and optimized financial support policies. It clarified priorities and key  measures in terms of effectively linking up the consolidation and expansion of poverty  eradication achievements with rural revitalization, optimized  the comprehensive system of financial organizations in rural areas, integrated and  improved financial products for rural development, and expanded direct financing  channels for agro-related areas. The PBC rolled out appraisal and assessment measures  on financial institutions鈥� services for rural revitalization in an attempt to enhance  incentive and constraint effects as well as to guide financial institutions to continuously  enhance their financial resource inputs in support of rural revitalization. At end-June  2021, outstanding agro-related loans increased 10.1 percent year on year to RMB41.66  trillion.  Financial support for key areas such as new types of agribusinesses was enhanced  remarkably. The PBC took the lead in issuing the Opinions on Extending Financial  Support for the Development of New Types of Agribusinesses (Yinfa No.133 [2021]).  It guided financial institutions to continuously boost the availability, coverage, and facility of financial services for new types of agribusinesses, promoted the integrated  development of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas, and enhanced  the quality, economic performance, and competitiveness of agriculture.  Financial support for key areas such as sci-tech innovations and the  manufacturing sector was strengthened. The PBC made efforts to enhance and  improve financial support for sci-tech innovations, to meet the effective financing  demands of core enterprises aimed at seeking key technology breakthroughs, and to  boost the availability of financing for tech-SMEs. Financial institutions were guided to  increase the supply of medium and long-term loans to the manufacturing sector so as  to promote its high-quality development. At end-June 2021, outstanding medium and  long-term loans to the manufacturing sector soared by 41.6 percent year on year, the  growth of which stood above 40 percent for four consecutive months. In particular,  growth of the high-tech manufacturing sector witnessed a year-on-year increase of 46.3  percent.  Financial support for green development was intensified. A symposium was held  on adjusting the credit structure of major nationwide banks. Financial institutions were  guided to increase their support for green and low-carbon industries. With the aim of  achieving the strategic goals of a carbon emissions peak and carbon neutrality, the PBC  introduced carbon neutrality-related special financial bonds and carbon neutrality related debt financing instruments on the interbank market so as to support projects  with significant effects on carbon emissions reductions. Based on market-oriented  principles, commercial banks were guided to provide reasonable and necessary support  for the transformation and upgrading of coal and other traditional energy industries.  VII. Further deepening the market-based interest rate reform  Since the beginning of 2021, the PBC further deepened the market-based interest-rate  reform, continuously unleashed the potential of the reform in reducing loan interest  rates, and optimized regulation of deposit interest rates, pushing actual loan rates further  downward. First, with continued progress in the loan prime rate (LPR) reform and  application of the LPR, the financing costs of enterprises witnessed a further decline.  Second, regulation of deposit rates was improved. After modification, the self disciplined ceiling of deposit rates will be determined by adding basis points to the  benchmark interest rates; this was formally put into practice on June 21. Third, order  in the credit market was regulated. Lenders of all sorts were promoted to explicitly  indicate the annualized interest rates of their loan products so as to effectively protect  the rights of financial consumers to be informed. Fourth, the PBC promoted a shift in  the pricing benchmark for USD floating-rate loans by financial institutions and it  guided the market self-discipline mechanism for interest rates to study and issue the  recommended agreement format for domestic USD floating-rate loans. Starting from  June 1, financial institutions can sign contracts for USD floating-rate loans with  reference to the format or they can make adaptive adjustments to the recommended  format based on actual conditions.  Box 4 Actual Loan Interest Rates were Generally Stable with a Decline  Since the beginning of 2021, the sound monetary policy has maintained stability as its  top priority, reflecting its feature of being forward-looking, targeted, and effective. With  the benefits of the loan prime rate (LPR) reform continuously unleashed, the PBC  improved regulations over deposit rates, promoted explicit indications of annualized  loan rates, safeguarded the sound competitive order in the market, and guided actual  loan rates to remain generally stable with a decline, compared with the historical lowest  level of 2020.  The PBC promoted financial institutions to improve application of the LPR  pricing mechanism and continuously released the potential of the LPR reform.  Banks were guided to incorporate the LPR into their internal funds transfer pricing (FTP)  so as to strengthen the benchmark role of the LPR in their internal and external pricing.  Up until now, all nationwide financial institutions have established relevant rules and  systems of FTP and have continuously improved their loan FTP mechanisms pegged to  the LPR, through which movement of the LPR may be promptly transferred to loan  rates. Locally incorporated financial institutions continuously improved establishment  of the FTP mechanism, with 63 percent of these institutions setting up internal FTP  management systems, 14 percentage points more than before the LPR reform.  Regulations over deposit rates were improved, with bank liability costs basically  stable. On June 21, 2021, the self-disciplinary mechanism for setting interest rates  optimized determination of the self-disciplinary ceiling for deposit interest rates, which  had shifted from multiplying the benchmark deposit rates by a designated multiplier to  adding basis points to the benchmark interest rates. This modification has not only  safeguarded financial institutions鈥� right of independent pricing but it has also  contributed to orderly market competition. Deposits are guided to return to an  appropriate maturity structure, and the liability costs of banks have stabilized. Currently,  all financial institutions have put in place the relevant requirements of the self disciplinary mechanism for setting interest rates, and the new self-disciplinary ceiling  of interest rates has been implemented in a stable and orderly manner. In terms of  quoted interest rates, they remain basically unchanged for nationwide banks, while  some have been adjusted downwards for medium and long-term deposits by some local  financial institutions that still meet the requirements for the new self-disciplinary  ceiling of interest rates. In practice, within the self-disciplinary ceiling, banks may  independently negotiate with the depositors so as to determine their respective deposit  interest rates.  Explicit indications of annualized loan rates were promoted to safeguard the vital  interests of financial consumers. On March 31, 2021, the PBC issued Announcement  No. 3 [2021], requiring all institutions conducting lending businesses to explicitly  indicate their annualized loan rates, and it specified the calculation methodology.  Meanwhile, the PBC directed the National Internet Finance Association of China to  study the incorporation of annualized loan rates into national standards as mandatory  disclosure requirements. By end-June, 2021, banking institutions had all explicitly  indicated their annualized loan rates, and over 6,000 lending institutions as well as  major internet financial platforms had basically completed this task. In general, explicit  indications of annualized loan rates help borrowers understand actual borrowing costs  and they effectively safeguard the right of financial consumers to be informed.  Actual loan interest rates were generally stable with a decline. Currently, the  Chinese economy has improved steadily with sound momentum, and its growth rate  has basically returned to its potential level. Financial support for the real economy is  strong and solid, and the growth rates of money supply and the AFRE are basically in  line with nominal economic growth. This demonstrates that from a macro perspective,  interest rates remain at a reasonable level in China, which provides a favorable interest rate environment for steady economic operations and high-quality development. In H1  2021, the weighted average rate on loans registered 5.07 percent, down 0.07 percentage  points year on year and 0.08 percentage point compared with that of 2020, respectively.  In particular, interest rates on corporate loans witnessed a greater drop. In H1 2021, the  weighted average rate on corporate loans fell by 0.16 percentage points year on year to  4.63 percent, down 0.09 percentage points compared with that in 2020. The financing  costs of the real economy remained generally stable, albeit with a decline. In an  international comparison, although they were slightly higher than those in the major  advanced economies, the interest rates in China remain relatively low among the  developing countries and the emerging economies. In addition, from the perspective of  the actual interest rates for corporate lending, they are generally on par with the major  commercial banks of China and the US. In Q1 2021, the average corporate lending rate  of the four major commercial banks in the US (Citibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo,  and JP Morgan) registered 4.03 percent, which was 4.04 percent of the four major  commercial banks in China (the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the  Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank).  Going forward, the PBC will perfect the market-oriented interest-rate formation and  transmission mechanism and improve the policy rate system of the central bank. It will  continue to unleash the potential of the LPR reform, smooth the transmission channels  for loan interest rates, optimize the allocation structure of financial resources, and  consolidate previous achievements in the reduction of loan interest rates. Meanwhile,  the PBC will optimize regulations over deposit interest rates, keep the banks鈥� liability  costs basically stable, and urge banks to transfer the policy benefits to the real economy  so as to further bring down the actual loan rates and to secure general stability with a  decline in the overall financing costs for MSBs.  VIII. Improving the market-based RMB exchange rate formation mechanism  The PBC continued to advance the market-based reform of the RMB exchange rate and  to improve the managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and  demand with reference to a basket of currencies. It enhanced the RMB exchange rate  flexibility and gave play to the role of the exchange rate in adjusting the macro economy  and as an automatic stabilizer for the balance of payments. The PBC attached  importance to guiding expectations and kept the RMB exchange rate basically stable at  an adaptive and equilibrium level. In H1 2021, the highest and lowest RMB central  parities were 6.3572 and 6.5713, respectively, against the USD. During the 118 trading  days, the RMB appreciated on 62 days and depreciated on 56 days. The biggest intraday  appreciation and depreciation were 1.0 percent (648 bps) and 0.8 percent (543 bps),  respectively. The RMB exchange rates against the other major international currencies  floated in two ways. At end-June, the central parities of the RMB against the dollar, the  euro, and the Japanese yen appreciated 1.0 percent, 4.4 percent, and 8.2 percent,  respectively, from end-2020, while the RMB central parity against the pound had  depreciated 0.6 percent during the same period. Since the reform of the RMB exchange  rate formation mechanism commenced in 2005, the RMB had appreciated by a  cumulative total of 28.1 percent, 30.3 percent, and 25 percent, respectively, against the  dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen by the end of June 2021. Direct RMB trading was  buoyant in the interbank foreign exchange market with stable liquidity, which helped  lower the exchange costs of micro economic entities and facilitated bilateral trade and  investment.  As of end-June, under the bilateral currency swap agreements between the PBC and  foreign monetary authorities, the foreign monetary authorities utilized a total of  RMB60.461 billion, and the PBC utilized foreign currencies equivalent to USD475  million. These operations played an active role in promoting bilateral trade and  investment. Box 5 A Norm of Two-way Fluctuations of the RMB Exchange Rate  In recent years, with the continuous progress in the reform of the RMB exchange rate  formation mechanism, the market has played a decisive role in the formation of the  exchange rate. The RMB exchange rate fluctuates in two ways, both upward and  downward, and the exchange rate flexibility is increasing, creating conditions for  independent implementation of a normal monetary policy.  The current managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and  demand with reference to a basket of currencies is suitable for China鈥檚 conditions  and should be maintained for a long time, which is the basis for the two-way  fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate. A mix of measures adopted by the PBC  work as an integral whole so that the two-way fluctuations of the RMB exchange  rate have become a norm, and the RMB exchange rate is kept basically stable at  an adaptive and equilibrium level. First, the market plays a decisive role in the  formation of the exchange rate. The PBC has withdrawn from regular intervention in  the foreign exchange market. The exchange rate, determined by market supply and  demand, plays the role of a price signal, which improves the efficiency of resource  allocations. Second, the reform of the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism has  been deepened. In October 2020, the counter cyclical factor faded out of the quotation  model of the RMB central parity against the USD. After the adjustment, the central  parity formation mechanism has become more transparent, benchmarking, and effective,  which also reflects that the market has been given full play in the self-discipline  mechanism of the foreign exchange market. Third, the macro-prudential management  framework for cross-border financing has been improved. Since 2020, in line with  macroeconomic conditions and the balance of payments, the PBC has adjusted the  macro-prudential parameter for cross-border financing of financial institutions and  enterprises and has expanded coverage of the macro-prudential management  framework for cross-border financing. Apart from raising management efficiency, the  PBC has also implemented differentiated policies according to the size of the financial  institutions, ensured the reasonable and orderly succession of policies, and guided  financial institutions to adjust the structure of their assets and liabilities in a market oriented manner. Fourth, expectation management has been emphasized. In the case of  large swings in the RMB exchange rate and market expectations, the PBC responded  actively to market concerns and communicated policy intentions with the market  through various channels so as to curb the overshooting of the foreign exchange market  and to safeguard the market鈥檚 sound operation. Fifth, liquidity in the foreign exchange  market has been adjusted effectively. On May 31, 2021, the PBC announced to raise  the reserve ratio for foreign exchange deposits of financial institutions by 2 percentage  points, from 5 percent to 7 percent. The adjustment was aimed at pumping out part of  the market liquidity and offsetting the impact of the external environment on the  domestic market. Sixth, enterprises and financial institutions have been guided to  establish the concept of 鈥渞isk neutrality.鈥� The PBC has guided financial institutions to  provide foreign exchange risk management services to enterprises in line with the  principle that foreign exchange management is based on real needs and should stick to  risk neutrality. Financial institutions have also been guided to maintain sound  operations in a bid to foster the stable and healthy development of the foreign exchange  market.  Beginning from 2020, the two-way fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate have  also reflected the differences in economic cycle and monetary policies at home and  abroad. In the midst of globalization, the economy and finance of various economies  are interacting with one another. The pandemic containment and economic recovery  have been advancing at different paces, and different monetary policies have been  adopted worldwide. The two-way fluctuation of the RMB exchange rate reflects that  the domestic and external economic cycles and monetary policies do not match one  another. In 2020, faced with the global economic impact of COVID-19, China stepped  up its macro-policy response and the PBC kept its sound monetary policy flexible,  appropriate, and targeted, all of which buttressed China鈥檚 leading role in pandemic  containment, resumption of work and production, and attainment of positive economic  growth. China鈥檚 monetary policy started to turn around to normal in May 2020, when  the pandemic was increasingly rampant elsewhere and ultra-loose monetary policies  were being adopted by the major economies. As a result, the RMB appreciated against  the USD and a basket of currencies. In 2020, the RMB central parity appreciated against  the USD by 6.9 percent, less than that of the euro, and the CEFTS index rose by 3.8  percent. Since the beginning of 2021, the COVID-19 vaccination has been making  progress in the developed economies, and reflation trade has been on the rise in the  market. The international financial market has been concerned that the US Fed may  reduce its quantitative easing and raise interest rates in advance. In June, the USD  appreciated against the major currencies, while China insisted on implementing its  normal monetary policies, with its economy operating near its potential growth rate.  The RMB depreciated by 1.4 percent against the USD in the same month, while the  CFETS index remained stable.  On the whole, the two-way fluctuation of the RMB exchange rate results from the  changes in domestic and external economic conditions, the balance of payments, and  the foreign exchange markets both at home and abroad. It reasonably reflects changes  in supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. It plays a role in adjusting the  macro economy and as an automatic stabilizer for the balance of payments, promotes  both internal and external equilibria, and helps expand the space for implementation of  an independent monetary policy. In the future, it will continue to be a norm for the RMB  exchange rate to fluctuate in two ways, and the RMB may either appreciate or  depreciate, which cannot be accurately predicted by any single person. Going forward,  the PBC will maintain the managed floating exchange rate regime based on market  supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. It will appropriately  employ multiple monetary policy tools, enhance macro-prudential management of  cross-border financing, reasonably guide expectations through various means, and help  enterprises and financial institutions establish the concept of 鈥渞isk neutrality鈥� so as to  keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level.  IX. Promoting reform of financial institutions and resolution of financial risks in  a prudent and orderly manner  Risk resolution and reform and restructuring of small and medium-sized financial  institutions have been promoted in an orderly manner. Since the takeover of the  Baoshang Bank (BSB), there has been steady progress in various relevant tasks,  breaking the rigid payments in an orderly manner, and completing liquidation and asset  verification on schedule. On January 12, 2021, Beijing No.1 Intermediate People鈥檚  Court held a creditors鈥� meeting for the first time, and the administrator completed a  review of the claims of 743 creditors. On February 7, Beijing No.1 Intermediate  People鈥檚 Court issued its ruling on the BSB鈥檚 bankruptcy. Equities of former  shareholders were cleared, and large creditors bore partial losses. Risk resolution of the  BSB was basically completed, and the follow-up work was advanced in a steady and  orderly manner. Moreover, the reform and restructuring plan of Hengfeng Bank was  carried out smoothly, and the risk resolution, reform, and restructuring of Jinzhou Bank  was basically completed so as to ensure the sound operation of the financial system and  to firmly defend the bottom line so that no systemic risk should occur.  The reform of development and policy financial institutions was continuously  deepened. The PBC advanced comprehensive reform plans for development and policy  financial institutions to redefine their responsibilities and business scope, implement  classified accounting, improve corporate governance, strengthen restraint mechanisms,  and prevent financial risks. The PBC guided development and policy financial  institutions to fulfill their responsibilities, focus on their main business, and give full  play to their role in supporting economic restructuring and high-quality development  on the basis of strengthening risk prevention and control.  X. Deepening reform of foreign exchange arrangements  Continue to strengthen positive incentives for trade facilitation pilot programs.  Persist in high standards when verifying the pilot conditions. Coverage of the  program was expanded in a steady and orderly manner and the pilot program was  further optimized. As of end-June 2021, the pilot program had been expanded to  incorporate 22 areas, 99 banks, and 909 enterprises.  New ideas for international trade management were explored. Based on the pilot  work in Hainan and other places regarding new international trade patterns, the PBC  has supported Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other regions with actual needs to develop new  offshore international trade and it has guided banks to improve their capability to verify  compliance so as to facilitate real and legitimate business activities.  Two-way individual foreign exchange business was facilitated. The State  Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) issued the Notice on Further Promoting  Facilitation of Individual Foreign Exchange Business under the Current Account  (Huifa [2021] 13), aiming to improve the banks鈥� capability to handle complex  individual current-account businesses. The SAFE also issued the Individual Foreign  Exchange Business Manual (First Edition) so as to popularize knowledge about  individual foreign exchange policies. Moreover, the SAFE guided its Guangdong and  Shenzhen branches to launch pilot programs to facilitate cross-border insurance  exchange under the current account and to promote the interconnectivity of insurance  markets in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau.  Stable and sound operation of the foreign exchange market was maintained. The  PBC enhanced the timeliness and accuracy of off-site inspections and placed emphasis  on punishing illegal financial activities, such as underground banks and cross-border  gambling. Special investigations of key entities were conducted so as to effectively  deter foreign exchange market violations and to maintain an orderly foreign exchange  market. In H1 2021, a total of 1290 foreign exchange violations were investigated and  penalized, with total fines amounting to RMB375 million.  Part 3. Financial Market Conditions  In H1 2021, the financial market generally operated smoothly and steadily. Money  market interest rates remained stable with active market transactions. The bond market  featured generally declining bond coupon rates, increased bond issuances, and  decreased cash bond transactions. The stock market index rose, and both turnover and  the amount of funds raised witnessed year-on-year increases.  I. Financial market overview  1. Money market interest rates remained stable, and the growth of market  transactions slowed down  Money market interest rates were generally stable. In June, the monthly weighted  average interest rate of pledged repos posted 2.17 percent, 16 basis points higher than  that in March. The monthly weighted average interest rate of government-backed bond  repos among depository institutions posted 2.04 percent, 13 basis points lower than the  monthly weighted average interest rate of pledged repos. In June, the monthly weighted  average interest rate for interbank lending posted 2.13 percent. At end-March, the  overnight and 7-day Shibor posted 2.18 percent and 2.41 percent, respectively.  Market transactions remain active. In H1 2021, the volume of bond repos trading on  the interbank market reached RMB471.4 trillion, representing an average daily turnover  of RMB3.9 trillion and almost on par with that in the previous year. The volume of  cumulative trading of interbank lending registered RMB58.1 trillion, with an average  daily turnover of RMB476.1 billion and a year-on-year decrease of 26.6 percent. In  terms of the maturity structure, overnight repos accounted for 83.6 percent of the total  turnover in bond repos, decreasing 1.2 percentage points year on year, and overnight  lending made up 89.2 percent of interbank lending, down 1.4 percentage points year on  year. The volume of bond repos traded on the exchange markets increased 21.6 percent  year on year to RMB156.2 trillion. Interbank Certificates of Deposit (CD) and negotiable CD businesses witnessed orderly  development. In H1 2021, 15,000 interbank CDs were issued on the interbank market,  raising RMB10.9 trillion. The volume of trading on the secondary market totaled  RMB70.8 trillion. At end-June, outstanding interbank CDs reached RMB12.4 trillion.  In H1 2021, the average weighted interest rate of 3-month interbank CDs was 2.70  percent, 8 basis points higher than that of the 3-month Shibor. A total of 33,000  negotiable CDs were issued by financial institutions in H1 2021, raising RMB6.2  trillion, with an increase of RMB200 billion year on year.  The turnover of interest rate swaps was stable. In H1 2021, the RMB interest rate swap  market witnessed 142,000 transactions, decreasing 1.9 percent year on year, with the  volume of the notional principal totaling RMB11.1 trillion, an increase of 12.7 percent  year on year. In terms of the maturity structure, contracts with maturities of up to one  year traded most briskly and the volume of the notional principal posted RMB8.0  trillion, accounting for 72.0 percent of the principal of all maturities. The 7-day fixing  repo rate and the Shibor served as the main reference rates for the floating leg of the  RMB interest rate swaps, accounting for 85.4 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively, of the total notional principal of the interest rate swaps. In H1 2021, interest rate swaps anchored to the LPR witnessed 419 transactions, with RMB43.29 billion of the notional principal.  The loan prime rate (LPR) interest rate option business developed steadily. The LPR  interest rate option business made its debut on the interbank market in March 2020, and  fixing repo rate (FDR) options were newly added to the interbank market on March 29,  2021. In H1 2021, a total of 266 interest rate option transactions were concluded,  totaling RMB46.66 billion.

Institutional arrangements in the bond market  To better serve market entities and actively respond to market needs, the PBC released  Announcement No. 4 [2021] of the People鈥檚 Bank of China (Revision of the  Announcement on Bond Trading and Circulation in the Interbank Bond Market). The  announcement further improved institutional arrangements and efficiency for bond  trading and circulation, thus enhancing the capability of the bond market to serve the  real economy. To be specific, first, it is clearly specified that infrastructure agencies  shall build direct connections among their systems to achieve an electronic transmission  of information. Second, issuers or lead underwriters are no longer required to provide  the National Interbank Funding Center (NIBFC) with a list of the initial bondholders  and their holdings. Third, the function of infrastructure agencies as intermediary service  providers has been strengthened.  2. Institutional arrangements in the capital market and the securities and futures  industry  The institutional design of the capital market was improved. In April 2021, the CSRC  released the Decision on Revising the 鈥淕uidelines for the Evaluation of Sci-Tech  Innovation Attributes (for Trial Implementation), which focused on supporting the core  goals of hard technology and emphasizing substance over form, implementing  classified processing and negative list management and further enriching the evaluation  indicators of science and technology attributes, and strengthening comprehensive  research and judgment. The Guidelines urged intermediaries to shoulder due  responsibilities and reinforce the supervision and inspection of implementation of the  rules so as to improve the quality of companies listed on the Science and Technology  Innovation Board at their source. In May, the CSRC released the Guiding Opinions on  Improving the Rules for Delisting on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations.  The Guiding Opinions improved the basic institutional framework for both voluntary  and forced delistings, clarified the post-delisting regulatory arrangements, and  emphasized the responsibility of the exchange, thus promoting a more standardized  market exit mechanism.  Protection of legitimate rights and interests of investors was strengthened. In May 2021,  the CSRC released the Elements of Asset Management Product Introduction鈥擯art 2:  Asset Management Plan and Related Products Offered by the Securities and Futures  Operators, which introduced the basic elements for asset management plans and  relevant securities and futures products, including their definitions, classifications,  operating modes, and risks, thus making it more convenient for investors to understand  the risk and return characteristics of the products. In June, the CSRC released two codes  concerning the content and format of information disclosures of listed companies for  the purposes of regulating the compiling of periodic reports and information disclosures  of listed companies as well as for safeguarding the investors鈥� rights to be informed.  Construction of an information-based capital market was promoted. In June 2021, the  CSRC released the Settlement Participant Code for the Securities and Futures Industry  and four other industry standards for the financial sector in order to encourage the  standardization of data and the exchange of information within the sector.  3. Institutional arrangements in the insurance market  An exclusive commercial pension insurance pilot was launched. In May 2021, the  CBIRC released the Notice on Exclusive Commercial Pension Insurance Pilots and it  decided to launch an exclusive commercial pension insurance pilot in Zhejiang  Province (including Ningbo City) and Chongqing Municipality for one year starting on  June 1, 2021. The PICC Life Insurance Company Limited and five other life insurance  companies were to carry out the pilot work. The Notice specified the methods of  payment, design of the accumulation period and annuitization period, the insurance  liabilities, rules for insurance cancellation, information disclosures, and product  management. It also made clear the regulatory support policies with respect to equity  asset allocations and the minimum capital requirement.  Corporate governance of insurance companies was improved. In June 2021, the CBIRC  released the Code of Corporate Governance of Banking and Insurance Institutions. The  Code, for the first time at the level of regulatory institutions, put forward general  requirements for the integration of the leadership of the CPC and corporate governance,  and they made clear that CPC organizations in private institutions shall be actively  availed of as political centers. The Code improved the regulatory rules for the corporate  governance of banking and insurance institutions, clarified the responsibilities of  corporate governance bodies, and further standardized operation of the corporate  governance mechanism.  Regulatory requirements for the recovery and resolution plans of insurance institutions  were improved. In June 2021, the CBIRC released the Interim Measures on  Implementing the Recovery and Resolution Plans of Banking and Insurance Institutions.  The Interim Measures specified key elements and the implementation process for the  recovery and resolution plans as well as regulatory management covering resolvability  assessment by regulatory authorities, the improvement of resolvability, and so forth.  The Interim Measures stressed that the recovery and resolution plans shall insist on  using the institution鈥檚 own assets, shareholder assistance, or other market-based  channels to raise funds to carry out a self-rescue, aiming at making institutions assume  primary responsibility and shareholders assume corresponding responsibility, and  avoiding moral hazards.  Part 4. Macroeconomic Overview  I. Global economic and financial developments  In Q2, the global economy on the whole continued to recover, but economic  performance diverged remarkably across regions. The labor market recovered slightly,  and inflation expectations rose remarkably amid the new uncertainties brought about  by the resurgence of the pandemic in many countries. In the future, evolution of the  pandemic will remain the fault line for a global economic recovery. In addition,  persistent high inflation, a possible acceleration of shifts in the monetary policy stances  of the major advanced economies, increased cross-border capital flows, and sharper  volatility of exchange rates and financial markets in the global economies, especially  in the emerging economies, also merit our attention.  1. Economic performance and financial markets of the major economies  The global economy on the whole maintained a momentum for recovery, but  divergences across regions were exacerbated. Among the advanced economies, the US  economic recovery showed a sound momentum as its annualized quarterly rate of GDP  in Q2 reached 6.5 percent and its Manufacturing and Services PMI in June registered  high levels of 60.6 and 60.1, respectively. In the euro area, the annualized quarterly rate  of GDP in Q2 reached 8.3 percent, and the Manufacturing PMI in June hit a record high  of 63.4. In Japan, the annualized quarterly rate of GDP in Q1 contracted to -3.9 percent,  and the Manufacturing PMI edged down to 52.4 in June. Among the emerging  economies, Brazil and India, both of which were severely affected by the pandemic,  witnessed year-on-year quarterly GDP growth of 0.96 percent and 1.64 percent,  respectively, in Q1. In India, the Manufacturing and Services PMI in June dipped to  48.1 and 41.2, respectively.  The resurgence of the pandemic posed a new challenge to prospects for an economic  recovery. Since March, the pandemic has rebounded in many countries, with the  number of single-day newly confirmed cases surpassing the 900,000 mark in April and  still standing at around 400,000 at end-June. Virus mutations and some countries鈥�  reopening of their economies despite the ongoing pandemic were the major reasons for  the resurgence of the pandemic. The delta variant, which is more contagious than the  previous variants, has been found in at least 98 countries and regions and has become  the prevalent strain in many countries. As a result, pressure for global pandemic  containment is mounting.  Recovery of the labor market was slow. The US unemployment rate registered 5.9  percent in June, edging up from 5.8 percent in May, which indicated that there was still  a long way to go for the job market to return to pre-pandemic levels. The labor  participation rate remained at the low level of 61.6 percent, while job vacancies in June  were over 2 million more than the average level in 2019, demonstrating a lack of  motivation for the unemployed to resume work and the existence of prominent  structural problems, such as the coexistence of difficulties in finding both employees  and employers. Unemployment rates in the euro area in June and the UK in May also  stood at high levels of 7.7 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively. According to the  projections of the International Labour Organization, global unemployment will stand  at no less than 220 million in 2021 and the labor market will not return to pre-pandemic  levels until 2023.  Elevated inflation was common across the globe. In the US, the year-on-year (y-o-y)  growth rate of the CPI increased to 5.4 percent in June, and that of the core CPI posted  4.5 percent, hitting a record high since 1992. In the euro area, the Harmonized Index of  Consumer Prices (HICP) grew by 1.9 percent year on year in June, standing at around  the policy target of 2 percent for two consecutive months. In Japan, deflation pressures  eased slightly, and the CPI in June grew by 0.2 percent year on year, turning positive  for the first time in nine months. Compared with the CPI, the PPI rose more notably. In  June, the PPI in the US and Japan grew by 7.3 percent and 5.0 percent year on year,  respectively, while that in the euro area grew more notably by 10.2 percent. Inflation  pressures also mounted in some emerging economies, with the IPCA of Brazil and the  CPI of Russia growing by 8.4 percent and 6.5 percent year on year, respectively, in June. In terms of the global economic recovery, there was a mismatch between supply and  demand, the prospects for recovery were precarious, market expectations diverged, and  financial markets became more volatile. Commodity prices continued to surge in Q2,  and they became more volatile in July. In Q2, the futures price of Brent crude oil  increased by 16.6 percent, and the futures prices of aluminum and copper in the London  Metal Exchange (LME) increased by 13.3 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively.  International oil prices fluctuated, rebounding after a remarkable drop in mid-July.  Treasury yields underwent adjustments in the advanced economies. Ten-year Treasury  yields in the US dropped from 1.74 percent at end-March to 1.45 percent at end-June,  while those in Germany went up to a high of -0.09 percent in May from -0.27 percent  at end-March and then dropped to -0.23 percent at end-June. On the whole, the stock  markets in the major economies rose, but the volatility increased.  2. Monetary policies of the major economies  Central banks in the major advanced economies maintain accommodative monetary  policy stances. In Q2, the US Fed kept policy rates and the scale of asset purchases  unchanged, but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in June discussed the  issue of tapering asset purchases. According to the dot-matrix plot, seven out of  eighteen FOMC members projected that policy rates would increase in 2022. The  FOMC in June also made technical adjustments to increase both the interest rate paid  on excess reserve balances and the overnight reverse repo rate by five basis points. The  European Central Bank kept policy rates unchanged and reiterated that it would  accelerate asset purchases, revise the monetary policy framework, and make an  adjustment to adopt a symmetric 2 percent inflation target over the medium term. The  Bank of Japan maintained its current monetary policy and will release plans that  encourage financial institutions to respond to climate changes.  Some emerging market economies began to increase policy rates in response to the  pressures of inflation, capital outflows, and a currency depreciation. Since the  beginning of 2021, the central banks of Russia and Brazil increased policy rates four  Unemployment Rate  (%)  2.6  2.8  2.8  2.9  3.0  3.0  3.1  3.0  3.0  2.9  2.9  2.6  2.8  3.0  2.9  CPI (year-on-year, %) 0.1  0.1  0.1  0.3  0.2  0.0  -0.4  -0.9  -1.2  -0.6  -0.4  -0.2  -0.4  -0.1  0.2  NIKKEI 225 (end of  the period)  20194 21878  22288 21710 23140 23185 22977  26434 27444 27663 28966 29179 28813 28860 28792times and three times, respectively, those in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Georgia, and other  countries increased policy rates twice, and those in Mexico, Turkey, Chile, and other  countries increased policy rates once. Against this backdrop, monetary policies  diverged among some emerging economies and advanced economies, which may have  an impact on an economic resurgence and may exacerbate imbalances in the global  economic recovery.  3. Issues that merit attention  First, the global economic recovery may be stalled by recurrent shocks from the  pandemic. Since March, the spread of Covid-19 variants at a faster pace in many  countries has led to a resurgence of the pandemic, which has been a drag on economic  recovery and has dampened market confidence to some extent. In the meantime, with  most developing countries facing vaccine shortages, there is a disparity in vaccination  progress across the globe, which may exacerbate the dual divergence of pandemic  containment and economic recovery.  Second, there is still a mismatch between supply and demand, and it remains to be seen  whether inflation will continue to rise. During the pandemic, ultra-loose monetary  policies adopted by the major advanced economies led to ample market liquidity and  substantial currency growth. In parallel, the pickup in demand outpaced that of supply  in the economic recovery, leading to chip shortages, and freight rates continued to hit  record highs. These have exerted upward pressures on commodity and durable prices.  As a result, short-term increases in global inflation have become a reality. However,  there are still big differences of opinion about whether inflation will continue over the  longer term, which requires close attention.  Third, the shifts in the monetary policies of the major advanced economies may have  spillovers and cause a spread of risks. In addition to increasing inflation pressures, huge  fiscal and monetary policy stimuli since the outbreak of the pandemic have also  spawned bubbles in asset prices, caused a deviation in financial markets from the real  economy, and increased vulnerability. An acceleration of monetary policy shifts in the  major advanced economies in the future may result in adjustments in the valuation of  financial markets, add to pressures on capital outflows and currency depreciation in  most emerging economies, and increase the risks of debt repayments and refinancing.  54II.

In June, among 70  medium and large-sized cities nationwide, newly built residential housing prices  increased by 4.3 percent year on year, decelerating by 0.1 percentage points from March,  and second-hand residential housing prices increased by 3.5 percent year on year,  accelerating by 0.2 percentage points from March. Due to the low base figure in the  previous year, housing sales and investments in real estate development experienced  relatively rapid year-on-year growth. In H1, total floor area of sold units increased by  27.7 percent year on year, registering average growth of 8.1 percent during the past two  years. Housing sales increased by 38.9 percent year on year, registering average growth  of 14.7 percent during the past two years. In H1, investments in real estate development  grew by 15 percent year on year, registering average growth of 8.2 percent during the  past two years. Specifically, investments in residential housing development rose by 17  percent year on year, registering average growth of 9.6 percent during the past two years  and accounting for 75.2 percent of total investments in real estate development.  On the whole, growth of real estate loans remained stable. At end-June, outstanding real  estate loans by major financial institutions (including foreign-funded financial  institutions) grew by 9.5 percent year on year to RMB50.8 trillion, a deceleration of 1.4  percentage points from end-March. Specifically, outstanding individual housing loans  grew by 13 percent year on year to RMB36.6 trillion, a deceleration of 1.5 percentage  points from end-March. Outstanding housing development loans grew by 3.4 percent  year on year to RMB9.4 trillion, a deceleration of 2.4 percentage points from end March.  7.2 Transformation and development of the coal industry toward achieving a  carbon emissions peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060  The supply-side reform in the coal industry made remarkable progress, which  established a solid foundation for adjustment of the energy structure and the transition  to low carbon development toward achieving a carbon emissions peak before 2030 and  carbon neutrality before 2060. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period from 2016 to  2020, the coal industry enjoyed a shift from extensive growth focusing on quantity and  speed to intensive development focusing on quality and benefits, basically forming a  supply pattern with an advanced production capacity as the mainstay. Arrangements for  coal exploitation continued to improve, with enhanced capability to secure a stable  supply. In 2020, the output of raw coal in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia added  up to 2.79 billion tons, accounting for 71.5 percent of total output in China, and the 14  major coal bases produced 96.6 percent of the coal in China. Structural adjustments in  the coal industry made new progress with a remarkably higher degree of industrial  concentration. At end-2020, a total of 5,500 collieries ceased to operate and the  shutdown of outdated coal production capacity exceeded one billion tons per year. The  number of collieries operating nationwide shrank to less than 4,700, with the top eight  producers producing 47.6 percent of total raw coal in China. Clean and efficient use of  coal has accelerated. Remarkable results were achieved in the comprehensive  management of scattered coal as well as in the reduction and replacement of coal use  with alternative energy sources. At end-2020, the installed capacity that had undergone  low-emission and energy-savings transformation in coal-fired power plants across  China reached 950 million kilowatts, accounting for 76 percent of the total installed  capacity of coal-fired power plants nationwide. The scattered coal consumption was  reduced by more than 200 million tons in the "Thirteenth Five-Year Plan" period.  For the coal industry, opportunities and challenges will coexist in the 14th Five-Year  Plan period from 2021 to 2025. Toward achieving its carbon emissions peak before  2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, stricter measures will be taken to control the  aggregate and intensity of coal consumption, and the proportion of coal in primary  energy consumption will continue to fall. However, some deep-rooted problems in the  coal industry that have been accumulating for a long time are yet to be solved, including  unbalanced productivity development in the industry, some enterprises still running at  a loss, and salient structural problems in coal production and coal products. Hence,  there is much pressure for a low-carbon transformation of the coal industry.  All in all, the function of coal-fired power as the last resort needs to be consolidated. In  the future, the coal industry should adapt to the new stage of development, building up  a new development paradigm for its production chain and supply chain as follows. First,  it needs to continuously improve arrangements in coal exploitation, make clear the  function of grand bases through reasonable classification, and enhance capability to  safeguard the power supply. Second, it should phase out excess production capacity,  shut down outdated production facilities, and build up advanced production facilities in  a way that improves coordination in the coal production chain. Third, it should promote  clean production and the clean and efficient use of coal and accelerate the shift toward  smart production, information-based management, a specialized division of labor, and  clean use of coal.  Part 5. Monetary Policy Outlook  I锛嶰utlook for the Chinese economy  Since the beginning of 2021, China has coordinated pandemic containment and  economic and social development, and the economy has continued recovering and  improving steadily. In Q2, GDP saw a year-on-year growth of 7.9 percent, with the  growth rate averaging 5.5 percent during the past two years, which was 0.5  percentage points higher than that in Q1. In the medium and long term, China鈥檚  development will still be at an important phase of strategic opportunities, and the  fundamentals of steady economic growth in the long run and high-quality  development will remain unchanged.  China's economy has continued to recover, and the momentum for growth has  been further enhanced. In Q2, the quality and efficiency of industrial production  improved, exports maintained fairly fast growth, investment and consumption sustained  steady recovery, the employment situation was generally stable, and market  expectations remained stable. All of these have established a good foundation for  economic performance in the second half of the year. The sound monetary policy has  maintained continuity, stability, and sustainability, and significant achievements have  been made in managing market expectations in a scientific way, serving the real  economy, preventing and controlling financial risks, and keeping the macro leverage  ratio basically stable. The RMB exchange rate is expected to be stable, and it has been  moving in both directions with enhanced flexibility, playing the role of a  macroeconomic stabilizer.  It should also be noted that the global pandemic continues to evolve, the external  environment is becoming more severe and complex, and the domestic economic  recovery remains unstable and imbalanced. The orderly vaccination has generally  boosted the global economic outlook, with the IMF and the World Bank in Q2 both  raising their global economic growth forecasts for 2021. However, with the recent  rampage of coronavirus variants in many countries and the resurgence of COVID-19  cases in several economies, there is still uncertainty about the future evolution of the  pandemic. The spillover effect of the ultra-loose monetary policy in the major  developed economies has become increasingly apparent, leading to significantly higher  inflation. If the pace of their monetary policy shifts accelerates, it may cause global  cross-border capital flows and exchange rate volatility to increase and financial market  valuations to adjust significantly. Domestically, the foundation for an economic  recovery is not yet solid as export growth may slow down due to the high base effect,  investment growth in some areas is relatively weak, contact-based consumption such  as catering and tourism have not been fully restored, and the sustainability of the  momentum for economic growth faces certain challenges. Enterprises鈥� operating costs  are pushed up as commodity prices rise sharply, bringing great difficulties especially to  some micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Close attention should be  paid to the pressure of a rebound of non-performing assets and shadow banking while  the medium and long-term challenges, such as the decline in potential economic growth  rate, the accelerating aging of the population and green transformation should not be  overlooked. Therefore, it is necessary to be confident and face up to the difficulties.  The PBC will focus on fulfilling its responsibilities by properly handling the  relationship between reforms and macro management, short-term and long-term  considerations, as well as internal and external equilibria in a bid to achieve high quality development.  The CPI is rising moderately and the PPI is rising temporarily. Overall, inflation  pressures are controllable, and there are no grounds for persistent inflation or  deflation. In Q2 2021, under the combined effects of the resumption of travel by  residents, rising gas and diesel prices, and falling pork prices, the CPI was at a low level  of about 1 percent, and was expected to move smoothly within a reasonable range in  the second half of the year. At the same time, due to rising commodity prices and the  low base effect, PPI growth has accelerated, which should be viewed historically and  objectively. On the one hand, as it is a high reading upon the low base of last year, the  change in the PPI can be viewed from an overall perspective based on the figures from  last year, this year, and next year; on the other hand, historically the PPI has witnessed  relatively large fluctuations, and it is not rare that it temporarily underwent a  considerable drop or a surge within a few months. Overall, the rise of China's PPI is  most probably temporary, and the PPI may remain relatively high in the short term. In  the future when the base effect subsides and global supplies gradually recover, the PPI  is likely to fall. In the medium and long term, the decline in labor productivity growth  and the aging population will curb inflation, while the explicit pricing of carbon  emissions will push up prices to some extent, hence being conducive to price stability.  As China's economy is improving steadily and a normal monetary policy has been  maintained since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, domestic aggregate supply and  demand are basically stable, which is conducive to keeping prices stable. Therefore,  there are no grounds for persistent inflation or deflation.  II. Outlook for monetary policy in the next stage  In the next stage, continuing to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism  with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the PBC will implement the guidelines of  the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the Central Economic  Work Conference and will put into practice the requirements set forth in the Report on  the Work of the Government. In line with the decisions and arrangements of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council, it will adhere to the general principle of  pursuing progress while ensuring stability, apply the new development philosophy fully,  faithfully, and comprehensively, deepen the supply-side structural reform, accelerate  the building of a new development paradigm, and promote high-quality development.  The PBC will work to align this year and next year鈥檚 macro policies in a coordinated  way, maintain the stability of monetary policy, enhance its foresightedness and  effectiveness, and firmly refrain from adopting indiscriminate stimulus measures. By  doing so, it will continue to focus on providing support for the real economy to help  sustain the recovery of small and medium-sized enterprises and industries in difficulties  and to keep the major economic indicators within a reasonable range. With these efforts,  we will get off to a good start for the 14th Five-Year Plan period and the economy will  see sound and sustained growth for the long term.  The sound monetary policy will be flexible, targeted, reasonable, and appropriate,  giving top priority to stability. The PBC will remain committed to conducting a normal  monetary policy and attach importance to cross-cycle policy design. The autonomy of  macro policies will be enhanced,, with policy intensity and pace aligned with the  domestic economic situation and price movements. The PBC will properly handle the  relationship between economic recovery and risk prevention to keep the economy  generally stable and to strengthen the resilience of economic development. It will build  a modern central banking system while improving the modern monetary policy  framework and the mechanism for money supply management. It will keep liquidity  adequate at a reasonable level so that the growth rates of money supply and aggregate  financing to the real economy (AFRE) are basically in line with nominal economic  growth, and the macro leverage ratio will be kept basically stable. Closely following  and studying price movements, the PBC will stabilize social expectations and keep  prices generally stable. In an effort to bring into play the guiding role of structural  monetary policy tools, it will work effectively to implement the decision to extend the  expiration dates of the two monetary policy tools providing direct support for the real  economy, and it will issue central bank lendings to provinces with slow credit growth.  Moreover, the PBC will take steps to put into operation the support instruments for  carbon emissions reduction, ramp up support for inclusive finance, and guide financial  institutions to intensify support for sectors such as sci-tech innovation, micro and small  businesses (MSBs), green development, and manufacturing. It will enhance the market oriented interest rate formation and transmission mechanism by further unleashing the  potential of the loan prime rate (LPR) reform, improving the central bank policy rate  system, optimizing regulation over deposit rates, and bringing down actual loan rates.  It will deepen the market-oriented exchange rate reform, enhance the RMB exchange  rate flexibility, stabilize market expectations, strengthen macro-prudential management  of cross-border financing, and guide enterprises and financial institutions to always be  risk-neutral, thereby keeping the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and  equilibrium level. With the aim of firmly defending the bottom line that no systemic  risk should occur, the PBC will improve the systems of financial risk prevention, early  warning, resolution, and accountability, set up a long-term mechanism for forestalling  and defusing financial risks, and replenish the capital of small and medium-sized banks  based on their conditions.  First, the PBC will maintain reasonable growth in money and credit as well as in  the AFRE. It will improve the mechanism for money supply management by enhancing  the long-term mechanisms of liquidity, capital, and interest rate constraints with which  the central bank adjusts money creation of commercial banks. The general valve of  money supply will be properly controlled so that the growth rates of money supply and  the AFRE will be basically in line with nominal economic growth and the macro  leverage ratio will be kept basically stable. A mix of monetary policy tools, such as the  Medium-term Lending Facility, open market operations, central bank lending, and  central bank discounts, will be used to keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level and  to guide market rates to move around policy rates. Moreover, the PBC will reinforce  monitoring and analysis of uncertainties, such as fiscal revenue and expenditures,  government bond issuances, and monetary policy adjustments by the major economies,  to further improve the foresightedness, flexibility, and effectiveness of operations. At  the same time, it will manage policy intensity and pace in line with the development of  the economic and financial situations to provide strong support for the real economy. It  will improve the mechanism for sustainable capital replenishment and prioritize support  for small and medium-sized banks in capital replenishment so that banks will be better  able to serve the real economy and to forestall and defuse financial risks.  Second, the PBC will move ahead with policy implementation to bring into play  the guiding role of structural monetary policy tools and will promote green low carbon development with the instrument supporting carbon emissions reduction.  It will keep central bank lending and discount policies stable while effectively  implementing the decision on extending the expiration dates of the two monetary policy  tools providing direct support for the real economy. It will continue to provide inclusive  and sustained funding support for agro-related businesses, MSBs, and private  enterprises, and it will keep up the intensity of financial support for MSBs so that they  can play a bigger role in stabilizing businesses and safeguarding employment.  Additionally, it will issue central bank lendings to provinces with slow credit growth in  order to support coordinated development across regions. To help reach the aims of  peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality, the PBC will take steps to  put into operation the instruments supporting carbon emissions reduction, which will  provide low-cost funds for eligible financial institutions to support lending at  preferential interest rates to those areas that will significantly reduce carbon emissions.  It will guide financial institutions to support green and low-carbon development in line  with market-oriented principles, promote concepts such as green low-carbon life and a  circular economy to the public, and encourage social investment and financing in green  low-carbon fields.  Third, the PBC will build the systems and mechanisms needed to provide effective  financial support for the real economy. It will make coordinated efforts to promote  the integrated development of inclusive finance, green finance, sci-tech innovation  finance, and supply chain finance, and it will improve the system for providing financial  support for sci-tech innovation to foster a virtuous cycle among the financial sector, the  sci-tech sector, and industries. It will push for an adjustment and optimization of the  regional credit structure, step up financing support via the multi-tiered capital market,  and improve the regional financial environment. It will ensure that efforts to consolidate  the achievements in poverty eradication join up effectively with rural revitalization  efforts, for which it will continue to provide financial services and support. Emphasis  will also be placed on providing financial services for new types of agribusinesses and  stepping up financial support for key fields, such as food security and development of  the seed industry, to promote the modernization of agriculture and rural areas. Financial  institutions will be urged to optimize their internal resource allocations and policy  arrangements and to enhance the use of sci-tech approaches so that they will be better  able to provide financial services for MSMEs and a long-term mechanism will be  formed whereby banks will have the confidence, willingness, ability, and  professionalism to provide loans. Moreover, the PBC will improve the system for the  management of carbon neutrality financial bonds to promote their well-regulated  development, and it will impose strict control over credit supply to energy-intensive  and high-emissions projects in order to push for their green transformation and  upgrading. Firmly adhering to the principle that housing is for living in, not for  speculation, and that the real estate market shall not be used to provide a short-term  stimulus to the economy, the PBC will remain committed to stabilizing land prices,  housing prices, and expectations, and it will maintain the continuity, consistency, and  stability of real estate finance policies. It will also implement rules for prudential  management of real estate finance and increase financial support for the rental of  housing.  Fourth, the PBC will deepen the market-oriented interest rate and exchange rate  reforms to smooth the channels of monetary policy transmission. It will enhance  the market-oriented interest rate formation and transmission mechanism by continuing  to unleash the potential of the LPR reform and improving the central bank policy rate  system to smooth the channels of interest rate transmission and further bring down  actual loan rates. It will optimize regulation over deposit rates, maintain fair  competition in the deposit market, and keep bank liability costs basically stable. In the  meantime, it will urge banks to transmit policy benefits to the real economy and will  increase competition in the MSB loan market so that MSBs can more easily receive  financing and their comprehensive financing costs will stabilize and fall. Taking steady  steps to deepen the market-oriented exchange rate reform, the PBC will improve the  managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with  reference to a basket of currencies, enhance the RMB exchange rate flexibility, and  bring into play the role of the exchange rate in macroeconomic management and as an  automatic stabilizer for the balance of payments. It will stabilize market expectations  and keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level.  The PBC will work on the development of the foreign exchange market. Guiding  enterprises and financial institutions to be risk-neutral, it will offer guidance to financial  institutions on the provision of services of exchange rate risk management for  enterprises with authentic needs based on the risk-neutral concept, thereby maintaining  the stable and sound development of the foreign exchange market. The PBC will  continue to advance RMB internationalization stably and prudently by launching the  pilot program of high-quality opening-up of cross-border trade and investment, further  facilitating use of the RMB in cross-border trade and investment, and steadily  advancing convertibility of the RMB under the capital account.  Fifth, the PBC will strengthen fundamental system building in the financial  market to serve the real economy and to guard against market risks. Placing equal  emphasis on preventing risks and promoting development, it will continue to advance  high-quality development of the bond market. In an effort to strengthen the legal  system building in the bond market, the PBC will see that intermediary institutions fulfil  their responsibilities, and it will push for implementation of the requirements for  information disclosures regarding corporate credit bonds and improve the regulations  on credit ratings. In line with market-oriented and law-based principles, the PBC will  continue to put into practice the newly formed mechanisms for bond default resolution  and will crack down on debt evasion. Continued efforts will be made to enhance  fundamental system building in the capital market so as to better protect the interests  of investors and promote the stable and sound development of the capital market.  Sixth, the PBC will push ahead further with the reform of financial institutions  and it will continue to improve corporate governance and optimize financial  supply. Focusing on strengthening corporate governance, it will deepen the reform of  large commercial banks and establish a modern financial enterprise system with  Chinese characteristics. Large banks will be guided to shift the focus of their services  to the primary level, while small and medium-sized banks will be encouraged to focus  on their main duties and businesses. With these efforts, the financial market is expected  to become more vigorous and resilient, and a modern financial system that is highly  adaptable, competitive, and inclusive will be developed. The reform of development  financial institutions and policy financial institutions will continue, with their  institutional framework improved according to the laws and regulations. Bank-specific  measures will be taken to start reform from incremental businesses and advance the  reform of existing businesses progressively and step by step. These measures are aimed  at carrying out category-based management of businesses and separate accounting,  gradually improving transparency, strengthening capital constraints as well as risk  management, enhancing incentives, and holding the institutions truly accountable. In  this way, the important role of development financial institutions and policy financial  institutions will be better brought into play in serving the real economy and supporting  national strategies.  Seventh, the PBC will improve the systems of financial risk prevention, early  warning, resolution, and accountability, and it will build a long-term mechanism  to forestall and defuse financial risks. It will pay special attention to monitoring and  screening potential risks in key fields, act quickly to shore up weaknesses in the  regulatory framework, accelerate its work to improve the modern financial regulatory  system, and strengthen regulatory coordination. While effectively giving play to the  deposit insurance system, it will focus on early rectification and will further improve  the mechanism for professional and market-oriented risk resolution under the deposit  insurance system. The PBC will make every effort to defuse existing risks and to  contain any possible resurgence of risks. It will intensify efforts to write off non performing assets in the banking system, while capital replenishments for small and  medium-sized banks will be conducted based on their conditions. Moreover, the PBC  will push for implementation of the mechanism for fiscal and financial risk resolution  led by major local officials to stress the responsibilities of local governments for local  risk resolution, and it will urge actions to bring down the number of high-risk  institutions in the provinces of concern. It will also push for implementation of  mechanisms, such as financial risk information sharing and accountability for major  financial risks, to effectively prevent moral hazards. The PBC will work towards  financial risk prevention that is more forward-looking, broad-sighted, and preemptive  so as to firmly defend the bottom line that no systemic risk should occur. Part 1. Money and Credit Analysis Since 2021, under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, following the guidelines of the Fifth and Sixth Plenary Sessions of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the Central Economic Work Conference, and implementing the requirements set forth in the Report on the Work of the Government, the People's Bank of China (PBC) kept its sound monetary policy flexible, targeted, reasonable and appropriate. Money, credit, and aggregate financing to the real economy (AFRE) gained reasonable growth, the credit structure continued to improve, and overall financing costs steadily declined, thereby notably propelling high-quality development of the real economy. I. Liquidity in the banking system was adequate at a reasonable level In 2021, according to the requirement that 鈥渢he sound monetary policy should be flexible, targeted, reasonable, and appropriate,鈥� the PBC pursued stability as its top priority and implemented intertemporal policy designs. A variety of policy tools, such as the required reserve ratio (RRR) cut, the Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF), central bank lending and discounts, and open market operations (OMOs) for liquidity provision were employed in a more forward-looking, flexible, and effective manner. In July and December, the PBC announced two RRR cuts, each of 0.5 percentage points, which released long-term funds of about RMB1 trillion and RMB1.2 trillion, respectively. Meanwhile, the PBC guided money market rates to move around the OMO rates by stabilizing market expectations in different ways. In 2021, the 7-day repo rates between depository institutions with government-backed bonds as the collateral in the interbank market (DR007) averaged 2.17 percent, close to the 7-day OMO rate at 2.2 percent, implying a further decline in the volatility of interest rates. At end-2021, the excess reserve ratio of financial institutions registered 2 percent, a high level for 2021 Liquidity in the banking system was adequate at a reasonable level.Box 1 Factors Influencing Liquidity in the Banking System and the Central Bank鈥檚 Liquidity Management Liquidity in the banking system mainly refers to excess reserves deposited by financial institutions in the central bank. It is influenced by a number of factors, including cash in circulation (M0), government deposits at the PBC, required reserves, net foreign assets held by the PBC, clients鈥� payment-settlement provisions held by payment institutions, etc. These factors have short-term and medium- to long-term impacts on liquidity. The latter is mainly caused by the following factors: the long-term growing trend of M0 led by economic and residential income growth; the part of government deposits with a steady increase; the increase in required reserves due to deposit creation as loans are issued in support of the real economy; and the growing trend of client provisions held by payment institutions. Meanwhile, the following factors contribute to the short-term impact. First, fluctuations in the fiscal deposits at the PBC. Their rapid rise reduces the liquidity of the banking system during peak tax periods (usually in the middle of a month) or when there are massive issues of government bonds. On the other hand, the concentrated fiscal expenditures at month/quarter/year-end boost liquidity. Second, a rise in the demand for cash during holidays. The public tend to withdraw large amounts of cash from banks on holidays, especially before the Spring Festival, causing liquidity in the banking system to temporarily drop by RMB1.5鈥�2 trillion and then to bounce back quickly as cash returns to the banking system after the Spring Festival. Third, temporary changes in required reserves as well as client provisions held by payment institutions. Based on analysis and projections of these short-term and medium- to long-term factors, the PBC undertakes a wide array of monetary policy tools, such as the required reserve ratio, the MLF, and open market operations to manage liquidity, so that liquidity remains adequate at a reasonable level, and supply and demand for each maturity is basically balanced. This guides market rates to move around the central bank鈥檚 policy rate. Based on their growth patterns, when addressing medium- to long-term factors, the PBC mainly uses the required reserve ratio and the MLF to increase medium- to long-term liquidity when and as appropriate so as to fully meet the demand for mediumto long-term liquidity that supports reasonable money and credit growth. In terms of short-term factors, while fully comprehending their historical patterns, the PBC uses tools such as open market operations for forward-looking and targeted marginal liquidity adjustment to iron out short-term factors and stabilize market expectations. In recent years, money market rates in China have stabilized. The weighted average rate on 7-day repos between depository institutions in the interbank market (DR007) fluctuated around the open market鈥檚 7-day reverse repo rate, with generally less volatility. When analyzing the liquidity conditions of the banking system, it is best to focus on the overall liquidity management framework other than particular factors. It is inappropriate to estimate the liquidity surplus or deficit by simply adding up short-term and long-term factors, or, furthermore, to assume that monetary policy instruments reaching maturity will have an influence and to judge liquidity conditions accordingly. In fact, under the current liquidity management framework, the PBC closely tracks market rates to conduct operations. Various monetary policy tools will be used flexibly to keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level, no matter how the factors influencing liquidity may change. Regarding maturing monetary policy tools, the PBC will properly arrange the pace of maturities and maintain inter-temporal liquidity management. Some maturing instruments will be rolled over in light of market developments to fully meet the reasonable demand for liquidity. From a market perspective, the most direct, accurate, and timely indicator of liquidity conditions is the market rate. Observations of the monetary policy stance should focus on policy rates such as rates on open market operations and the MLF, and on the overall movement of market rates during a certain period. It would be inappropriate to focus excessively on quantity factors including the quantity of liquidity and the size of open market operations.II. Lending by financial institutions grew reasonably, with the annual corporate loan interest rate at a record low since the reform and opening up Growth of total credit was more stable. Amid positive factors for economic growth and flourishing loan demands at the beginning of 2021, the PBC guided financial institutions to stabilize the pace of loan issuances in the first half of the year, especially in the first quarter, so as to leave some room for uncertainties in the second half of the year. In the second half of the year, the domestic economy faced downward pressure, and credit demands slowed down sharply. In response, through the PBC鈥檚 forward guidance, financial institutions enhanced the stability of credit growth, coordinated cross-year credit policies, and consolidated financial support for the real economy. Thus, RMB loans achieved a stronger year-on-year increase in 2021. At end-2021, outstanding loans issued by financial institutions in domestic and foreign currencies grew 11.3 percent year on year to RMB198.5 trillion, increasing RMB20.1 trillion from the beginning of 2021, or a year-on-year acceleration of RMB308.8 billion. Outstanding RMB-denominated loans grew 11.6 percent year on year to RMB192.7 trillion, up RMB19.95 trillion from the beginning of 2021, or a year-on-year acceleration of RMB315 billion. Loans grew by RMB7.7 trillion, RMB5.1 trillion, RMB4.0 trillion, and RMB3.2 trillion for each of the four quarters of 2021, respectively. Quarterly increments accounted for 38.5 percent, 25.5 percent, 19.9 percent, and 16.2 percent, respectively, which were basically flat with the previous year. The credit structure has been improving. At end-2021, medium and long-term loans to enterprises and public entities grew by RMB9.2 trillion from the beginning of the year, accounting for 76.8 percent of total corporate loans. Medium and long-term loans to the manufacturing sector increased by 31.8 percent. In particular, the high-tech manufacturing sector witnessed a year-on-year increase of 32.8 percent. Outstanding inclusive loans to micro and small businesses (MSBs) grew by 27.3 percent year on year to RMB19.2 trillion. These loans supported 44.56 million MSBs, rising 38 percent year on year.Box 2 Maintaining Stable Growth of Credit Aggregates Since the beginning of 2021, in line with the arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the PBC has implemented a prudent monetary policy that is flexible, targeted, reasonable, and appropriate. In the first half of the year, the PBC employed a mix of monetary policy instruments to keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level, made good use of central bank lending and two monetary policy tools that provide direct support for the real economy, improved supervision of deposit rates, and guided financial institutions to maintain their support for the real economy. In the second half of the year, in response to the triple pressures on the economy, i.e., shrinking demand, supply shocks, and waning expectations, the PBC enhanced intertemporal adjustments, coordinated cross-year policies, and urged financial institutions to step up their support for the real economy so as to promote stable growth of credit aggregates and to keep economic performance within a reasonable range. First, keeping liquidity adequate at a reasonable level. The PBC injected liquidity into the market by RRR cuts, open market operations, and the MLF. In July 2021, a preemptive RRR cut of 0.5 percentage points was made, and approximately RMB1 trillion of long-term funds were unleashed, paving the way for the sustainable and stable economic recovery in the second half of the year. In December, the PBC cut the RRR by another 0.5 percentage points, which freed up about RMB1.2 trillion of long-term funds, effectively broadened the stable long-term funding source of financial institutions, and thus buttressed the development of the real economy in a better way. At the beginning of 2022, the PBC increased liquidity injections by the MLF and open market operations, creating a favorable liquidity environment for an appropriate growth of money and credit and a stable macro economy as a whole. Second, guiding financial institutions to step up their support for the real economy. The PBC held a meeting with financial institutions on the monetary and credit situation in August and December, respectively, guiding financial institutions to maintain stable growth in credit aggregates. The PBC made efforts to further improve the macro prudential assessment (MPA) framework and encouraged banks to increase their support for inclusive loans to MSBs as well as medium and long-term loans to the manufacturing sector. Central bank bills swap (CBS) operations were conducted on a regular basis to support banks to replenish capital through perpetual bond issuances, thereby further enhancing sustainability of the financial sector鈥檚 capacity to serve the real economyThird, giving full play to both aggregate and structural monetary policy instruments. The structural monetary policy instruments have actively done a good job in providing additional financial support. At the beginning of 2021, RMB200 billion in central bank lending was added to support locally incorporated banks in areas with sluggish credit growth to expand lending. In September, the PBC increased central bank lending in support of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) financing by RMB300 billion. In November, the PBC launched the carbon emission reduction facility (CERF) and set up RMB200 billion worth of special central bank lending targeted for clean and efficient coal use, aiming to promote the development of clean energy, energy conservation, environmental protection, carbon reduction technology, clean and efficient use of coal and other relevant key areas, and to boost overall energy supply. In December, the two monetary policy instruments that directly support the real economy were converted into market-based policy tools in support of MSBs. These structural monetary policy instruments not only promoted optimization of the credit structure but also boosted the stable growth of credit aggregates. Fourth, steadily bringing down overall financing costs of enterprises. The role of the loan prime rate (LPR) reform has been brought into full play, the quality of quotes by LPR quoting banks have been improving, and financial institutions have been encouraged to use the LPR as a pricing reference for bank lending. The one-year LPR rate went down by 5 basis points in December 2021. In January 2022, both the oneyear MLF rate and the 7-day open market operation rate dropped by 10 basis points, while the one-year and over-5-year LPR rates declined by 10 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively, further bringing down actual lending rates. In December 2021, rates of central bank lending in support of agro-related businesses and MSBs were cut by 0.25 percentage points, marking stepped-up support for these sectors. The PBC also made significant achievements to improve the supervision of deposit interest rates. The self-regulatory ceiling for deposit interest rates has shifted from multiplying the benchmark deposit rates by a designated multiplier to adding the basis points to the benchmark interest rates. In the meantime, the PBC strengthened its management of non-local deposits absorbed by locally incorporated banks. All these efforts contributed to reducing debt costs for banks. The PBC, together with the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) and other relevant departments, strived to reduce the overall financing costs of enterprises, especially MSBs, through multiple measures, including cutting interest rates, reducing fees, and launching a number of tools that could directly support the real economy. A series of policies and measures have achieved remarkable results. RMB loans saw an increase of RMB19.95 trillion in 2021, which surpassed that recorded in 2020 by RMB315 billion, indicating stable growth of credit aggregates. At end-2021, M2 and the AFRE witnessed year-on-year growth of 9 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, which were basically in line with the nominal economic growth rate. As for the twoyear average, the growth rates of M2 and the AFRE in 2020 and 2021 were 9.5 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively, which were basically in line with or slightly higher than the two-year average nominal economic growth. Going forward, the PBC will continue to follow the guidelines of the Central Economic Work Conference. Pursuing stability as its top priority and seeking progress while ensuring stability, the PBC will continue to implement a prudent monetary policy that is flexible and appropriate, enhance intertemporal policy adjustments, and keep the liquidity adequate at a reasonable level through a mix of monetary policy instruments so as to maintain stable growth of credit aggregates and to keep the growth rates of money supply and the AFRE basically in line with nominal economic growth. The PBC continued to deepen the market-based reform of interest rates and to tap into the efficiency of the LPR reform. Play was given to the guiding role of the LPR, and the one-year LPR in December 2021 was decreased by 0.05 percentage points. In the meantime, the PBC optimized regulation of deposit rates and lowered the interest rate on central bank lending for rural development and MSBs by 0.25 percentage points, promoting a steady drop in the actual loan rates. In December, the one-year LPR and the over-five-year LPR stood at 3.80 percent and 4.65 percent, respectively, with the one-year LPR down 0.05 percentage points and the over-five-year LPR on par with that in December 2020. The weighted average lending rate recorded 4.76 percent in December, a decline of 0.27 percentage points year on year. In particular, the weighted average interest rate on ordinary loans registered 5.19 percent, down 0.11 percentage points year on year. The weighted average corporate lending rate fell by 0.04 percentage points year on year to 4.57 percent. The average corporate loan interest rate in 2021 was 4.61 percent, a drop of 0.1 percentage points from 2020 and 0.69 percentage points from 2019, reaching its lowest level in the past four decades of the reform and opening up. In December, the share of ordinary loans with rates above, at, or below the LPR registered 67.75 percent, 6.98 percent, and 25.27 percent, respectively. Compared with 2021, the floating range of loan rates around the LPR as a whole moved downward.Interest rates on foreign-currency deposits and loans declined slightly. In December, the weighted average interest rates on demand and large-value USD-denominated deposits with maturities within 3 months registered 0.10 percent and 0.31 percent, down 0.06 and 0.28 percentage points from December 2020, respectively. The weighted average interest rates on USD-denominated loans with maturities within 3 months and with maturities between 3 months (including 3 months) and 6 months both registered 1.11 percent, down 0.11 percentage points and 0.25 percentage points from December 2020, respectively. Deposits grew steadily. At end-2021, outstanding deposits in domestic and foreign currencies in all financial institutions increased 9.3 percent year on year to RMB238.6 trillion, up RMB20.2 trillion from the beginning of 2021 and an acceleration of RMB70.3 billion. Outstanding RMB deposits grew 9.3 percent year on year to RMB232.3 trillion, an increase of RMB19.7 trillion from the beginning of the year and an acceleration of RMB32.3 billion. Outstanding deposits in foreign currencies stood at USD996.9 billion, an increase of USD107.7 billion from the beginning of 2021 and a deceleration of USD23.8 billion. III. Money supply and aggregate financing to the real economy grew at a reasonable pace Money and credit aggregates maintained reasonable growth, providing strong support for the real economy. Outstanding M2 recorded RMB238.3 trillion at end-2021, increasing 9.0 percent year on year. Outstanding M1 and M0 registered RMB64.7 trillion and RMB9.1 trillion, respectively, increasing 3.5 percent and 7.7 percent year on year, respectively. The year of 2021 witnessed a net cash injection of RMB651 billion, which was RMB61.5 billion less than that in the previous year. According to preliminary statistics, the outstanding AFRE reached RMB314.13 trillion at end-December. Year-on-year growth registered 10.3 percent, decelerating 3 percentage points compared to the growth recorded at end-2020. The AFRE increment in 2021 totaled RMB31.35 trillion, dropping RMB3.44 trillion year on year. Growth of money supply and the AFRE featured the following: first, loans issued by financial institutions to the real economy maintained stable growth. In 2021, loans issued to the real economy denominated in both RMB and foreign currencies increased by RMB20.11 trillion, which was on par with 2020 and RMB3.36 trillion more than that in 2019. Second, debt financing returned to normal, while equity financing exhibited a significantly larger year-on-year increase. In 2021, net financing through government bonds posted RMB7.02 trillion, RMB1.31 trillion less than that in 2020 when RMB1 trillion of special government bonds was issued for the COVID-19 response. Net debt financing by non-financial enterprises dropped by RMB1.09 trillion to RMB3.29 trillion, while their domestic equity financing registered RMB1.24 trillion, an increase of RMB343.4 billion over that in the previous year. Third, off-balance sheet financing recorded a notable year-on-year drop. Net financing through entrusted loans, trust loans, and undiscounted bankers鈥� acceptances exhibited a net decrease of RMB2.67 trillion, which was RMB1.35 trillion larger than the decrease in 2020. Box 3 China鈥檚 Macro Leverage Ratio Remains Generally Stable First, China has achieved notable results in stabilizing its leverage ratio. sectors to its GDP. Preliminary data show that China鈥檚 macro leverage ratio at end-2021 dropped by 7.7 percentage points from the year before to 272.5 percent, a decline for the fifth successive quarter, and China has made notable progress in stabilizing its leverage ratio. By sectors, at end-2021, the leverage ratio for the country鈥檚 non-financial companies, households, and government agencies registered 153.7 percent, 72.2 percent, and 46.6 percent, respectively, compared with the previous year, a decline of 8.0 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points for the first two sectors, and a rise of 0.7 percentage points for government agencies. Compared with the major economies, the increase in China鈥檚 macro leverage ratio is relatively manageable in the wake of COVID-19. The latest data from the BIS show that the leverage ratio in the U.S. (286.2 percent), Japan (416.5 percent), and the euro area (284.3 percent) at end-Q2 in 2021 added 31.3 percentage points, 37.1 percentage points, and 27.2 percentage points from end-2019, respectively. Over the corresponding period, China鈥檚 leverage ratio rose 19.9 percentage points from end-2019 to 275.9 percent, and its increase was 11.4 percentage points, 17.2 percentage points, and 7.3 percentage points lower than the U.S., Japan, and the euro area, respectively. Therefore, China has supported the rapid post-COVID economic recovery with relatively fewer new debts and, comparatively, its macro leverage ratio is not high. Second, the solid COVID-19 response, steady economic recovery, effective macro policies, and other factors all contribute to China鈥檚 generally stable macro leverage ratio. On the one hand, the key to stabilizing the macro leverage ratio lies in China鈥檚 notable progress in its COVID-19 response and its sustained economic recovery. Nominal GDP is the denominator in the calculation of the macro leverage ratio, and its growth rate significantly affects the movement of the leverage ratio. China鈥檚 GDP growth slowed markedly under the impact of COVID-19, and its macro leverage ratio rose during this period. The CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, oversaw the general situation and made the important decision to coordinate the COVID-19 response with economic and social development. These efforts made China the first country to bring COVID under control, to restart work and production, and to achieve positive economic growth. Economic growth became more resilient, which played a prominent role in stabilizing the leverage ratio. China鈥檚 nominal year-on-year GDP growth accelerated by 10.1 percentage points to 12.8 percent in 2021, markedly driving the macro leverage ratio lower. By quarters, starting from Q2 in 2020, the growth margin of macro leverage ratio moderated until it turned downward. The increase in the leverage ratio during the first three quarters of 2020 stood at 14.1 percentage points, 7.4 percentage points, and 4.1 percentage points, respectively, while the ratio declined by 1.4 percentage points, 2.1 percentage points, 2.2 percentage points, 0.7 percentage poinst, and 2.7 percentage points, respectively, from Q4 2020 to Q4 2021, falling for five consecutive quarters. On the other hand, macro policies with strength, appropriate intensity, and efficiency stabilized the fundamentals of the economy with manageable new debts. First, policies are strong. Prudent monetary policies have become more flexible, appropriate, and targeted with a prompt and strong response since the outbreak of COVID-19. Monetary support measures of over RMB9 trillion have been introduced, and financial institutions made RMB1.5 trillion in interest concessions to boost the real economy. All sectors have greater awareness of the financial support. Therefore, the sense of fulfillment of the sectors in the real economy has grown stronger. Meanwhile, fiscal policies have become more proactive to offset the impact of COVID-19, with the introduction of large-scale measures to help businesses get through the tough times. Net government bond financing in 2020 reached RMB8.32 trillion, an increase of RMB3.6 trillion from the previous year. On balance, macro policies were coordinated appropriately to foster strong synergies to ensure stability on six key fronts and to maintain security in six key areas, and the fundamentals of the economy were kept stable. Second, policies have been introduced with appropriate intensity. The PBC has maintained a prudent monetary policy by refraining from a deluge of strong stimulus policies and continuing with conventional monetary policies. Monetary policy has gradually shifted since May 2020 to its conventional stance, and since 2021 the PBC has maintained a forward-looking policy with continuity and consistency, stepped up intertemporal adjustments, and provided an enabling environment for a steady economic recovery. During 2020 and 2021, the growth rate of M2 and the AFRE averaged 9.5 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively, in line with and modestly higher than the average nominal GDP growth rate. Thanks to these developments, debt growth in China鈥檚 non-financial sectors was rather measured and manageable. Outstanding debt aggregates in 2021 increased 9.7 percent year on year, 2.7 percentage points lower than the growth at end-2020. This figure is at a historically low level, 7.3 percentage points lower than the average growth rate of debt aggregates from 2009 to 2019. Third, policies are effective. By focusing on serving the real economy and ensuring that stability is a top priority, monetary policy maintained steady growth of money and credit. By smoothing the transmission of monetary policy and continuously advancing the LPR reform, monetary policy guided the marked decline in corporate funding costs. By making policies more targeted and providing direct support to the real economy, financial support policies were phased in to leverage the dual functions of monetary policy instruments in the adjustment of aggregates and structure. Moreover, the difficult fight against financial risks curbed both funds from being diverted out of the real economy and from disorderly expansion, and financial reforms advanced steadily with enhanced quality and efficiency in financial services. All these measures enhanced the efficiency of financial services for the real economy and helped the relatively quick post-COVID economic recovery with fewer new debts. Third, the macro leverage ratio in 2022 is expected to remain generally stable. The Central Economic Work Conference noted that economic work next year should prioritize stability while pursuing progress, and macro policies should be prudent and effective to strengthen the driving force for self-generated development. The steady decline in China鈥檚 macro leverage ratio will provide room for the financial system to ramp up support for its real economy. Meanwhile, good COVID-19 prevention and control and growing economic resilience will also provide conditions for continued stability of its macro leverage ratio. In the next phase, the PBC will keep prudent monetary policy flexible and appropriate, step up intertemporal adjustments, enhance the stability in the growth of credit aggregates, and see that increases in money supply and aggregate financing are generally in step with economic growth in nominal terms. This 鈥渋n step with鈥� mechanism itself contains the notion of 鈥渒eeping the macro leverage rate generally stable.鈥� As the economic recovery continues and the driving force for self-generated development strengthens, the macro leverage ratio will remain generally stable in 2022.IV. The RMB exchange rate remained basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level In 2021, cross-border capital flows and foreign exchange supply and demand have been basically in equilibrium, and market expectations have been generally stable. The managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies worked well. Based on market supply and demand, the RMB exchange rate moved in both directions with enhanced flexibility, playing its role as an automatic stabilizer in adjusting the macro economy and the balance of payments. Market factors and policy factors effectively corrected exchange rate deviations, and the RMB exchange rate remained basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. During 2021, the RMB appreciated modestly against a basket of currencies. At yearend, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) RMB exchange-rate index and the RMB exchange-rate index based on the special drawing rights (SDRs) basket closed at 102.47 and 100.34, respectively, up 8.1 percent and 6.5 percent from end- 2020. According to calculations by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), from end-2020 to end-2021, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the RMB appreciated 8.0 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, and from the reform of the exchange rate formation mechanism that began in 2005 to end-2021, appreciation of the NEER and the REER of the RMB registered 48.7 percent and 58.2 percent, respectively. At end-2021, the central parity of the RMB against the US dollar was 6.3757, appreciating 2.3 percent from end-2020 and 29.8 percent on a cumulative basis since the reform of the exchange-rate formation mechanism that began in 2005. In 2021, the annualized volatility rate of the RMB against the US dollar was 3.0 percent. In 2021, cross-border RMB settlements increased 29 percent year on year to RMB36.6 trillion, with RMB receipts and payments posting RMB18.5 trillion and RMB18.1 trillion, respectively. Cross-border RMB settlements under the current account grew by 16 percent year on year to RMB7.9 trillion, among which RMB settlements of trade in goods registered RMB5.8 trillion, whereas RMB settlements of trade in services and other items registered RMB2.1 trillion. Cross-border RMB settlements under the capital account registered RMB28.7 trillion, increasing 33 percent year on year. Specifically, RMB settlements of direct investments posted RMB5.8 trillion, while RMB settlements of securities investments recorded RMB21.2 trillion. Part 2. Monetary Policy Operations In Q4 2021, the PBC resolutely implemented the decisions and arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, kept the sound monetary policy flexible, targeted, reasonable and appropriate, enhanced intertemporal adjustments, coordinated cross-year policies, and brought into play the dual functions of monetary policy tools in adjusting the credit aggregate and structure. By lowering the required reserve ratio (RRR), strengthening the use of structural monetary policy instruments, unleashing the benefits of the LPR reform and other approaches, the PBC put emphasis on strengthening the stability of aggregate credit growth, continuously scaled up support for weak links and key areas, further promoted the steady decline of overall financing costs for enterprises, and contributed to stabilizing the whole macro economy, thereby fostering a favorable monetary and financial environment for high-quality economic development. I. Conducting open market operations in a flexible manner Conducting open market operations in a flexible manner. In Q4 2021, the PBC strengthened market monitoring and cross-cyclical liquidity adjustments. Based on the adoption of monetary policy instruments such as RRR cuts and the Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) to provide medium and long-term liquidity, the PBC conducted successive daily open market operations and managed the intensity of operations flexibly to timely offset the impacts of fiscal expenditures and revenue, issuance of government bonds, and temporary or seasonal factors such as the National Day holiday and the year end, thus maintaining liquidity in the banking system at a reasonable and adequate level. In late December, the PBC conducted 14-day reverse repos in a phased manner to release cross-year liquidity in advance, and it moderately intensified operations in an attempt to maintain a basic equilibrium between supply and demand of the cross-year funds. Meanwhile, by properly arranging the operation timing and maturities, the PBC ensured that the funds that had been supplied at year-end would be withdrawn timely upon their maturity after New Year鈥檚 Day so as to effectively ensure the stability of liquidity and money market operations across the year. Guiding market rates to move around central bank policy rates in a reasonable manner. In Q4 2021, the rates paid on open market operations (OMO) remained unchanged. Since the beginning of 2021, the institutional building of open market operations has achieved remarkable results. First, the PBC sent successive short-term policy rate signals through daily open market operations in a bid to stabilize market expectations. In addition, the PBC clarified that OMO rates were short-term policy rates and guided the weighted average rate on 7-day repos between depository institutions in the interbank market (DR007) to move around the policy rates within a range. Liquidity expectations of financial institutions became more stable at key junctures, such as quarter-end and year-end. Demand for precautionary liquidity dropped significantly, and money market rates remained stable. In 2021, the DR007 averaged 2.17 percent, approximating the 2.20 percent of the central bank鈥檚 7-day OMO rate. On January 17, 2022, the PBC conducted a total of RMB700 billion of MLF operations and RMB100 billion of 7-day reverse repos. The rates paid on the MLF and the openmarket operations both declined by 10 basis points to 2.85 percent and 2.10 percent, respectively. The operations increased liquidity supply and offset the impacts of the tax payment peak in January, the accelerated issuance of government bonds, cash provisions before the Spring Festival, and other short-term factors in advance, thus keeping liquidity adequate at a reasonable level. The declined rates paid on the MLF and the open-market operations showed that the proactive response and quick measures taken at an early stage regarding monetary policy were conducive to uplifting market confidence and to promoting a steady decline in the comprehensive financing costs for enterprises. Continuously conducting central bank bill swap (CBS) operations. In Q4 2021, the PBC conducted CBS operations three times, with the total amount registering RMB15 billion. The maturity of each operation was three months, at a fixed rate of 0.10 percent. In 2021, the PBC conducted CBS operations regularly on a monthly basis, and these operations have played a positive role in boosting liquidity in the secondary market of bank-issued perpetual bonds and in supporting the issuance of perpetual bonds to replenish capital as well as in enhancing the stability of aggregate credit growth by banks, especially by small and medium-sized banks. Issuing central bank bills in Hong Kong on a regular basis and introducing the market-maker mechanism for central bank bill repos. In Q4 2021, the PBC issued three batches of RMB-denominated central bank bills in Hong Kong, totaling RMB30 billion. Specifically, the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year bills registered RMB10 billion, RMB5 billion, and RMB15 billion, respectively. In 2021, the PBC issued twelve batches of RMB-denominated central bank bills totaling RMB120 billion. In January 2021, the Bank of China (Hong Kong) introduced the market-maker mechanism for RMB-denominated central bank bill repos in Hong Kong. A total of RMB309 billion of central bank bill repo transactions were completed in 2021, with the scope of institutional participants continuously expanding. The regular issuance of central bank bills and the introduction of the market-maker mechanism for central bank bill repos in Hong Kong enriched the scope of RMB investment products and RMB liquidity management tools in Hong Kong, which played an active role in promoting the sound development of the offshore RMB money market and bond market and in propelling both domestic and overseas market entities to issue RMB-denominated bonds and to conduct RMB business in the offshore market. According to statistics, in 2021 offshore RMB bond issuances, excluding RMB-denominated central bank bills issued in Hong 21 Kong, registered over RMB180 billion, an increase of 38 percent year on year. The RMB offshore money market and bond market are becoming increasingly buoyant. II. Timely conducting Standing Lending Facility and Medium-term Lending Facility operations Conducting MLF operations in a timely manner. To ensure an appropriate supply of medium and long-term liquidity and to give play to the signaling and guiding functions of the medium-term policy rates, the PBC conducted a total of RMB4.55 trillion of MLF operations in 2021, all with a maturity of one year and an interest rate of 2.95 percent. In particular, the amount of MLF operations posted RMB0.8 trillion, RMB0.45 trillion, RMB1.3 trillion, and RMB2.0 trillion in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. At end-2021, the outstanding MLF registered RMB4.55 trillion, RMB0.6 trillion less than that at the beginning of 2021. On January 17, 2022, MLF operations were conducted with a rate paid at 2.85 percent, down 10 basis points. Advancing the reforms of electronic SLF operations. The entire process of conducting SLF operations became electronic in an orderly manner, which enhanced operational efficiency, stabilized market expectations, and strengthened the stability of liquidity in the banking system. In 2021, the PBC conducted a total of RMB76.03 billion SLF operations, of which RMB47.51 billion, RMB11.55 billion, RMB2.75 billion, and RMB14.22 billion of SLF operations were conducted in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. At end-2021, the balance of SLF operations registered RMB12.68 billion. The SLF rate played its role as the ceiling of the interest rate corridor, and it promoted the smooth operation of money market rates. At end-2021, the overnight, 7- day, and 1-month SLF rates stood at 3.05 percent, 3.20 percent, and 3.55 percent, respectively, on par with the rates at end-Q3. On January 17, 2022, SLF rates of all maturities were lowered by 10 basis points each. After the rate cut, the overnight, 7-day, and 1-month SLF rates stood at 2.95 percent, 3.10 percent, and 3.45 percent, respectively.III. Adjusting the required reserve ratio for financial institutions In Q4, 2021, the required reserve ratio for financial institutions was lowered by 0.5 percentage points in an attempt to support the real economy and to promote the steady decline of overall financing costs. The PBC reduced the required reserve ratio by 0.5 percentage points, effective on December 15, 2021 (not applicable to financial institutions that had already implemented a required reserve ratio of 5 percent). Meanwhile, financial institutions that participated in the assessment of the targeted RRR cut for inclusive finance were all entitled to the most preferential required reserve ratio, releasing about RMB1.2 trillion of long-term funds. After this round of RRR cuts, the weighted average required reserve ratio for financial institutions stood at 8.4 percent. This RRR cut is a conventional operation, aimed at enhancing intertemporal adjustments, improving the funding structure of financial institutions, and strengthening the capacity of the financial sector to serve the real economy. First, the PBC kept liquidity adequate at a reasonable level, effectively expanded the sources of long-term stable funding for financial institutions, and enhanced their capability to allocate funds. Second, the PBC guided these institutions to actively use the funds released from the RRR cut to boost support for the real economy, especially micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Third, the RRR cut lowered the funding costs of financial institutions by approximately RMB15 billion per year, which further reduced the overall financing costs for enterprises through the transmission of financial institutions. The two across-the-board RRR cuts of 0.5 percentage points for each in 2021 released a total of about RMB2.2 trillion of long-term funds. The foreign exchange required reserve ratio was raised for financial institutions, and foreign exchange liquidity management of financial institutions was enhanced. The PBC raised the foreign exchange required reserve ratio by 2 percentage points, from 7 percent to 9 percent, effective on December 15, 2021, freezing around USD20 billion of foreign exchange liquidity. In 2021, the PBC raised the foreign exchange RRR twice, both by 2 percentage points, freezing a total of about USD 40 billion of foreign exchange liquidity. IV. Further improving the macro prudential management framework The role of the macro prudential assessment (MPA) was effectively brought into play to optimize the credit structure and to promote the supply-side structural reform of the financial sector. In 2021, the PBC further improved the framework of the MPA and the assessment mechanism, and it attached importance to their guidance on both the aggregate and the structure of credit. By adjusting and optimizing relevant assessment indicators in a dynamic manner, the PBC guided financial institutions to enhance the stability of growth of credit aggregates and to continue to ramp up support for the real economy, especially by issuing loans to inclusive MSBs and medium and long-term loans to the manufacturing sector. Guidelines on Macro-Prudential Policies (Trial) were released. On December 31, 2021, the PBC released the Guidelines on Macro-Prudential Policies (Trial) (hereinafter referred to as the Guidelines). Based on the actual situation in China, the Guidelines specify elements for establishing a sound macro-prudential policy framework. First, they define concepts related to macro-prudential policies, such as the macro-prudential policy framework, systemic financial risks, and the workingmechanisms of the macro-prudential management. Second, they lay out the major content of the macro-prudential policy framework, including its policy objectives, assessment of systemic financial risks, policy tools, transmission mechanisms, and governance mechanisms. Third, they put forward the support and safeguards as well as the policy coordination requirements necessary for the effective implementation of macro-prudential policies. Promulgation of the Guidelines is a major measure for establishing a sound macro-prudential policy framework, which is conducive to building a smooth governance mechanism of macro-prudential policies, to developing a coordinated system of forestalling and defusing systemic financial risks, and to promoting sound development of the financial system. The regulatory framework for systemically important financial institutions was improved. To improve the regulatory framework of Systemically Important Banks (SIBs), the PBC drafted the Additional Regulatory Rules on SIBs (Trial) jointly with the CBIRC, and solicited public opinions starting from April 2, 2021, which were officially released on October 15, entitled Order No.5 [2021] of the PBC and CBIRC. The Order specifies. requirements for additional regulation, recovery and resolution plans, and prudential regulation, providing guidance and standards for implementing regulation of the SIBs. On October 15, the PBC and CBIRC also published a list of domestic SIBs. A total of nineteen banks were identified as domestic SIBs on the basis of the data assessment in 2020, including six state-owned commercial banks, nine jointstock commercial banks, and four city commercial banks. The regulatory system for financial holding companies (FHCs) was further improved. Since the beginning of 2021, the PBC has made proactive efforts to carry out administrative approvals of FHCs. On March 31, it released the Interim Regulations on Filing-based Management of Directors, Supervisors, and Senior Executives of Financial Holding Companies (Order No.2 [2021] of the PBC) (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations). The Regulations clarify that the PBC should perform the duties of filing and supervising directors, supervisors, and senior executives of FHCs, and they specify the eligible conditions for personnel and the relevant filing procedures. In addition, the PBC reinforced appointment management so as to regulate the operation of FHCs and to guard against relevant risks. V. Actively giving play to the role of structural monetary policy instruments Actively using central bank lending to support rural development, central bank lending for MSBs, central bank discounts, and other instruments to guide financial institutions to enhance support for key areas and weak links in the national economy and for coordinated regional development. The PBC gave full play to the role of central bank lending to support rural development and central banklending for MSBs in providing targeted liquidity and serving as positive incentives, and it guided locally incorporated financial institutions to expand credit supply for MSBs, private firms, agriculture, rural areas, and rural people. Central bank lending for poverty alleviation was rolled over according to the current regulations so as to support and consolidate the effective connections between achievements in poverty eradication and rural revitalization. In ten provinces with slow credit growth, locally incorporated financial institutions were guided further to make good use of the quota of RMB200 billion of central bank lending and to step up support for the economic weak links, such as local agro-related businesses, MSBs, and private firms, so as to promote coordinated regional development. More relief and assistance was provided for market entities, especially MSMEs. The new quota of RMB300 billion central bank lending for micro and small businesses (MSBs) was fully utilized, effectively satisfying the financing demand of MSBs and self-employed businesses hard hit by mounting commodity prices and COVID-19, and substantially reducing the financing costs. As of end-2021, outstanding central bank lending to support rural development stood at RMB496.7 billion. Outstanding central bank lending for MSBs and for poverty alleviation posted RMB1.2351 trillion and RMB175.0 billion, respectively. Outstanding central bank discounts registered RMB590.3 billion. In 2021, the PBC made net withdrawals of PSLs in the amount of RMB433.4 billion from development and policy banks, with net withdrawals in Q4 totaling RMB82.7 billion and the outstanding PSLs registering RMB2.8017 trillion at end-2021. Steadily advancing the two monetary policy instruments that directly support the real economy to bolster the development of MSBs. At end-2021, the instrument supporting deferred repayments on inclusive MSB loans provided a total of RMB21.7 billion in incentive funds. This has directly motivated locally incorporated banks to defer repayments on RMB2.17 trillion inclusive MSB loans and for nationwide financial institutions in the banking sector to defer payments on RMB16 trillion loans, easing the phased pressures on MSBs to repay the principal and interest. The support plan for inclusive unsecured MSB loans provided a total of RMB374.0 billion in preferential funding. This has directly motivated locally incorporated banks to issue RMB1.05 trillion in unsecured MSB loans and for financial institutions in the banking sector nationwide to issue RMB10.3 trillion in inclusive unsecured MSB loans, thereby effectively alleviating the financing difficulties of MSBs. According to the arrangements of the executive meetings of the State Council, the PBC converted the instrument supporting deferred repayments on inclusive MSB loans into the support plan for inclusive unsecured MSB loans in a market-based way so as to provide financial support for stabilizing enterprises and securing employment in a more sustainable manner.Box 4 Two Instruments Directly Supporting the Real Economy Continue with Modified Arrangements MSBs play a major role in the national economy as these numerous and wide-ranging market entities are the major representatives of market dynamism and job creators. To ease the shocks of COVID-19 on MSBs, the PBC, following the arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, implemented two monetary policy instruments directly supporting the real economy from June 2020 to end-2021, namely, the instrument supporting deferred repayments on inclusive MSB loans and the support plan for inclusive unsecured MSB loans. The two instruments supported locally incorporated banks to defer the repayments on the principal and interest of loans for MSBs in temporary difficulty and encouraged these banks to increase unsecured loans to MSBs. They have reduced the phased pressures on MSBs to repay the principal and interest, eased the shortage of collateral and financing difficulties facing MSBs, and have played a positive role in securing market entities and employment. As MSBs are struggling amid downward economic pressures in China, further enhancing financial support for them is favorable for stabilizing enterprises, securing employment, and ensuring the overall stability of the macro economy. Following the decisions of the executive meetings of the State Council on further enhancing financial support for MSMEs in a market-based way, the PBC issued a timely notice announcing that from January 1, 2022, the two monetary policy instruments directly supporting the real economy will continue with modified arrangements. First, the instrument supporting deferred repayments on inclusive MSB loans will be converted into the instrument supporting inclusive MSB loans. From the beginning of 2022, financial institutions and businesses may independently negotiate their terms on principal and interest repayments in line with market-based principles. From the beginning of 2022 to end-June 2023, for inclusive MSB loans issued by locally incorporated banks, the PBC will provide funding in the amount of 1 percent of their incremental balance of these loans, thus encouraging the expansion of inclusive MSB loans. The instrument supporting inclusive MSB loans has an incentive mechanism to motivate locally incorporated banks to serve MSBs and to increase the volume, lower the price, and expand the coverage of MSB financing. First, the instrument targets six types of eligible locally incorporated banks, including urban commercial banks, rural commercial banks, rural cooperative banks, rural credit cooperatives, village banks, and private banks (including Internet banks). Second, the instrument provides funding for locally incorporated banks based on the increment of MSB loan balance. Through monetary policy operations, the PBC provides 1 percent of the quarter-on-quarterincrement (the increase at the end of a quarter compared with the previous quarter) of the inclusive MSB loan balance for these banks. The funding is examined and issued on a quarterly basis. If the quarter-on-quarter increment is negative, it will not be calculated until it is adequate in future quarters so as to promote the continuous growth of the inclusive MSB loan balance. Providing incentives on the basis of the loan increment will not only guide locally incorporated banks to continuously support the borrowing demand of old customers, but also motivate them to tap into new customers. Third, the sound principle should be upheld. To prevent moral hazards, the credit risks of relevant loans will still be shouldered by locally incorporated banks so as to encourage sound banks with potential to enhance support for MSBs on the premise of risk prevention and control. Second, from 2022 the support plan for inclusive unsecured MSB loans will be incorporated into the management of central bank lending that supports rural development and MSBs. The quota of RMB400 billion central bank lending originally arranged to support inclusive unsecured MSB loans may be rolled over, and if necessary, may be further increased. Eligible locally incorporated banks that issue inclusive unsecured MSB loans may apply to the PBC for preferential funding of central bank lending that supports rural development and MSBs. It aims to make this type of central bank lending more targeted, direct, and effective, guiding locally incorporated banks to continuously expand credit supply to agro-related businesses, MSBs, and private firms. Going forward, the PBC will, in line with market-based and law-based principles, give full play to the guiding role of market-based policy instruments after the conversion of the two monetary policy instruments directly supporting the real economy. It will further motivate locally incorporated banks to enhance support for MSBs, MSB owners, and self-employed businesses, tap into proper financing demands, increase the proportion of inclusive unsecured MSB loans, and increase the volume, lower the price, and expand the coverage of inclusive MSB loans so as to ease the financing difficulties and reduce the financing costs for MSBs. The carbon emission reduction facility (CERF) and special central bank lending targeted for the clean and efficient coal use were launched, contributing to achievement of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in a scientific and orderly manner. According to the decisions of the executive meetings of the State Council, the PBC launched the CERF to support three major areas of carbon reduction, namely, clean energy, energy conservation and environmental protection, and carbon reduction technology. It also launched special central bank lending targeted for the clean and efficient coal use to support seven relevant areas, including mass clean coal production and the application of clean combustion technology. In November 2021, the PBC released the Notice on Launching the CERF (Yinfa No.278 [2021]) and the Notice on Launching Special Central Bank Lending Targeted for the Clean and Efficient Coal Use (Yinfa No.289 [2021]), stipulating that the two instruments adopt a direct mechanism whereby 鈥渃entral bank lending follows corporate loans.鈥� Under this facility, financial institutions can apply to the PBC for funding support after issuing loans to enterprises in relevant areas at preferential rates on the premise of making independent decisions and bearing the risks on their own. For financial institutions issuing qualified loans, the PBC provides low-cost funds in the amount of a specified proportion of the principal. To be specific, the CERF and special central bank lending targeted for the clean and efficient coal use provide 60 percent and 100 percent of the loan principal, respectively, both at a rate of 1.75 percent. In Q4, the PBC granted the first batch of funds to relevant financial institutions through the aforementioned two instruments, totaling RMB88.2 billion. In particular, the CERF and the special central bank lending for the clean and efficient use of coal posted RMB85.5 billion and RMB2.7 billion, respectively. Going forward, the PBC will ensure effective implementation of these two instruments, promote financial institutions to provide credit support for carbon emissions reductions and the clean and efficient use of coal, and facilitate the transition to a green and low-carbon economy while ensuring security of the energy supply so as to contribute to the achievement of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in a scientific and orderly way. Box 5 Exploring the Conducting of Stress Tests on Climate Risk From August to November 2021, the PBC organized some banking institutions to perform the climate risk stress test based on sensitivity analysis and to assess the potential impact of China鈥檚 transition toward the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in the banking sector so as to strengthen the capacity of banking institutions to manage climate鈥搑elated risks. The participating banks consisted of two development and policy banks, six large commercial banks, twelve joint-stock commercial banks, and three city commercial banks. Mainly focusing on enterprises with annual CO2 emissions above 26,000 tonnes of thermal power, and the steel and cement industries (based on definition of the standards of the major greenhouse emission entities set by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment), the testing examined the effects of the rising cost of carbon emissions on the enterprises鈥� capacity to service debts and also on the quality of related credit assets held by the participating banks as well as their capital adequacy level. The test adopted the following methodology and assumptions: on stress scenarios, three types of carbon prices were specified based on mildly adverse, adverse and severely adverse scenarios, with the main reference to the price changes in the domesticcarbon emissions market and to the carbon price scenarios from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). On the key assumptions, first, enterprises were assumed to pay for their carbon emissions based on a certain ratio, which rose every year; second, it was assumed that there is no technological progress and a single enterprise has no bargaining power upstream or downstream; third, insolvent enterprises were assumed to default on their loans. On risk transmission channels, target enterprises were assumed to face growing production costs and declining profitability due to expenditures on carbon emissions, leading to a rise in the probability of loan defaults and expected bank losses as well as an adverse impact on the capital adequacy level of banks (as the figure below shows). The test set end-2020 as the baseline with a ten-year horizon. If a participating bank meets all the regulatory requirements on its post-stress CET1 ratio, Tier 1 ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR) (including additional capital requirements for systemically important banks) in 2030, it will be regarded as passing the stress test.According to the test results, without a low-carbon transition, the enterprises of thermal power, steel, and cement industries would face a weakened capacity to service debts under the stress scenarios. However, as the proportions of loans to such industries were not high for the participating banks, the aggregate CAR met the regulatory requirements under all three stress scenarios. At end-2020, the provision coverage ratio of the participating banks reported 222.56 percent, with the loan provision ratio at 3.22 percent and the CAR at 14.89 percent. Under the mildly adverse, adverse and severely adverse scenarios, the aggregate CAR of the participating banks will decline to 14.57 percent, 14.42 percent, and 14.27 percent at the end of 2030, respectively, above the regulatory requirements. As a preliminary exploration of the PBC for assessing the impacts of climate risk on the financial system, the test鈥檚 stress scenarios and key assumptions do not represent the existing policies or future policy orientations. Based on the test, the utmost challenge lies in insufficient disclosures of carbon emissions information and the big data gap in China, and the testing methodology also needs improvements. The results will not be used as a basis for policy decisions. Looking forward, the PBC will continue to improve the methodology for climate risk stress test based on sensitivity analysis, expand its industrial coverage, and further explore the climate risk stress test based on macroeconomic scenarios.. VI. Leveraging the structural guidance role of credit policies Financial support to stabilize businesses and secure employment was stepped up. The Project of Enhancing the Capacity to Provide Financial Services for MSMEs was further advanced in a bid to promote MSB financing featuring 鈥渋ncreased volume, expanded coverage, and lowered prices.鈥� As of end-2021, outstanding inclusive loans to MSBs grew by 27.3 percent year on year to RMB19.2 trillion. These loans supported 44.56 million MSBs, an increase of 38 percent year on year. The weighted average interest rate on new inclusive loans to MSBs posted 4.93 percent in 2021, dropping by 0.22 percentage points from 2020, a decline outstripping the overall drop of corporate loan interest rates. By focusing on key support groups and key businesses, the PBC made innovations in a variety of activities bridging government agencies, banks, and businesses to promote more effective and better-targeted financing connections. The campaign to 鈥渆xtend loans to small businesses to enhance people鈥檚 well-being鈥� was carried out to provide financial support for the development of self-employed individuals, and problems of pressing concern for these individuals were addressed through strengthening connections of financing information and moving ahead the financing service window, i.e., providing financial services in a proactive and welltargeted manner. Financial support to culture and tourism, accommodations and catering, retail, foreign trade, and other sectors has been stepped up. As of end-2021, a list of key enterprises was developed, comprising 515,000 firms in industries hit by COVID-19 and core businesses in the supply chain, and financial institutions extended cumulative loans of RMB8.3 trillion, boosting and stabilizing jobs for 35 million people. Financial support to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty eradication was put in place, and rural revitalization was promoted on all fronts. Continued efforts have been made to put in place the Opinions on Financial Support for Consolidating and Expanding Achievements in the Critical Battle against Poverty and Promoting Rural Revitalization on all Fronts, which encourage and guide financial institutions to strictly follow the requirements of the 鈥淔our Withouts,鈥� i.e., lifting areas out of poverty without loading off responsibilities, without abolishing policies, without ceasing support, and without removing supervision, so as to provide continuous support for the development of regions and population that had been lifted out of poverty. Meanwhile, the PBC ensured financial services to key areas that safeguard an efficient supply of grain and vital agricultural products as well as to key entities such as new types of agribusinesses, encouraged innovation in tailored financial products and services, and made consolidated efforts to provide better financial services. As of end- 2021, outstanding agro-related loans increased 10.9 percent year on year to RMB43.21 trillion. VII. Deepening the market-based interest rate reform Since 2021, the PBC has adopted reform measures to smooth the transmission of monetary policy. The benefits of the loan prime rate (LPR) reform were continuously unleashed, and a steady decline in overall corporate financing costs was promoted. First, the PBC encouraged financial institutions to fully tap into the LPR in pricing so as to enhance competition in the MSB loan market. The central bank lending rate in support of agriculture and MSBs was cut by 0.25 percentage points in December 2021, and the one-year LPR was lowered by 5 basis points in the same month, so the actual lending rates moved further downward on the basis of the significant decline in 2020. In December, the weighted average lending rate dropped by 0.27 percentage points year on year to 4.76 percent and the weighted average interest rate on corporate loans fell by 0.04 percentage points to 4.57 percent. Second, the PBC implemented measures to improve regulation over deposit rates and maintained fair competition in the deposit market. It modified the mechanism for a self-regulatory ceiling of deposit rates by adding basis points to the benchmark interest rates so as to guide the medium and longterm deposit rates to move down, to improve the term structure of deposits, to reduce banks鈥� liability costs, and to promote the steady decline of overall corporate financing costs. Third, the PBC advanced the market-based interest rate reform of credit card overdrafts. It has removed the upper and lower limits on credit card overdraft interest rates from January 1, 2021, and the issuers and users can negotiate their own interest rates for credit card overdrafts. Fourth, the PBC continued to promote lenders of all sorts to explicitly post the annualized interest rates of their loan products so as to protect the lawful rights and interests of financial consumers. Fifth, the PBC continued to advance the onshore transition of international benchmark interest rates. It organized the release of recommended loan agreements based on onshore USD floating interest rates and the standard document for the backup mechanism of the Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) in the NAFMII master agreement. It guided and urged major banks to be well prepared for the benchmark transition in areas of signing the agreement, communicating with customers, internal training, system upgrading, etc., thus responding appropriately to the LIBOR reform.VIII. Improving the market-based RMB exchange rate formation mechanism The PBC continued to advance the market-based reform of the RMB exchange rate and to improve the managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. It enhanced the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate and gave play to the role of the exchange rate as an automatic stabilizer in adjusting the macro economy and the balance of payments. The PBC attached importance to guiding expectations and kept the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. In 2021, the highest and lowest RMB central parities against the USD were 6.3498 and 6.5731, respectively. During the 243 trading days, the RMB appreciated on 128 days and depreciated on 115 days. The biggest intraday appreciation and depreciation were 1.0 percent (648 bps) and 0.8 percent (543 bps), respectively. The RMB exchange rate appreciated against other major international currencies. At end-2021, the central parities of the RMB against the dollar, the euro, the pound, and the Japanese yen appreciated 2.3 percent, 11.2 percent, 3.3 percent, and 14.1 percent, respectively, from end-2020. Since the reform of the RMB exchange-rate formation mechanism that commenced in 2005 to end-2021, the RMB appreciated by a cumulative total of 29.8 percent, 38.7 percent, and 31.8 percent, respectively, against the dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen. Meanwhile, direct RMB trading was buoyant in the interbank foreign exchange market with stable liquidity, which helped lower the exchange costs of micro economic entities and facilitated bilateral trade and investment. As of end-2021, under the bilateral currency swap agreements between the PBC and foreign monetary authorities, foreign monetary authorities utilized a total of RMB61.532 billion and the PBC utilized foreign currencies equivalent to USD342 million. These operations played an active role in promoting bilateral trade and investment.IX. Forestalling and defusing financial risks and deepening the reform of financial institutions New achievements were made to forestall and defuse financial risks. The PBC adhered to the disposal of risks in a market-oriented and law-based manner, with total financial risks decreasing. The disposal of risks of key conglomerates and large enterprises was steadily advanced. The risk disposal of existing high-risk institutions was continuously promoted, with the number of high-risk institutions decreasing notably. The China Financial Stability Report (2021) was issued, continuously improving risk monitoring of the banking, securities, and insurance sectors and the financial market. The Administrative Measures on the Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity of Global Systemically Important Banks were issued and implemented, ensuring that the global systemically important banks in China are fully capable of absorbing losses and recapitalization. The central bank rating of financial institutions in Q3 was completed, with over 4,000 banking financial institutions being rated throughout the nation. As a result, actual risk exposure was ascertained, and high-risk institutions were identified precisely. The PBC conducted annual stress tests on over 4,000 banking financial institutions, and risk monitoring of large enterprises was conducted on a quarterly basis. Box 6 Key Achievements in Forestalling and Defusing Major Financial Risks After the 19th National Congress of the CPC made the important arrangement of 鈥渞esolutely fighting the critical battle of forestalling and defusing major financial risks,鈥� under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the Financial Stability and Development Committee under the State Council (hereinafter referred to as the FSDC) has taken a lead. The PBC has earnestly fulfilled its role as the General Office of the FSDC, cooperated with relevant departments and local governments in steadily promoting the relevant tasks, made major periodic achievements in fighting the critical battle, and firmly defended the bottom line so that no systemic risks should occur. Thus, favorable economic and financial environments have been created for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. First, macro risks are under effective control. The PBC has maintained a sound monetary policy, has ensured an appropriate aggregate supply of money, and has kept the macro leverage ratio stable. From 2017 to 2019, the macro leverage ratio was kept stable at about 250 percent, with annual growth of about 2 percentage points, creating policy space for the subsequent fight against COVID-19 and strengthening intertemporal policy adjustments. Under the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, China鈥檚 economic growth witnessed a certain period of an obvious slowdown. With Xi Jinping at its core , the CPC Central Committee made important decisions and arrangements regarding coordination between pandemic prevention and control and social and economic development. The macro polices are powerful, well-calibrated, and effective, stabilizing the economic fundamentals with debt growth under control. At end-2020, the macro leverage ratio rose temporarily to 280.2 percent, which witnessed a subsequent steady decrease and fell to 272.5 percent by end-2021. Second, resolution of key high-risk institutions has been conducted in a steady manner. Ten financial institutions controlled by 鈥淢ingtian Group鈥�, such as Baoshang Bank (BSB), Huaxia Life Insurance, and New Times Securities, have been taken over in a decisive and orderly manner, with bankruptcy and liquidation of BSB steadily completed. Resolution of the Huaxin Group is generally completed and that of the Anbang Insurance Group is reaching a conclusion. The restructuring plan of the HNA Group has been approved by the court. Together with the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the PBC has guided the relevant local governments to steadily resolve the risks of large enterprises, such as the Founder Group, and those of small and medium-sized financial institutions, such as Hengfeng Bank. In addition, while focusing on major risks, the authorities also took the whole picture under surveillance, and enhanced early warning and timely resolution of risks. The PBC has continuously promoted risk disposal of high-risk rural small and medium-sized banking institutions and has promptly contained the sporadic bank runs at the branch levels. Third, efforts have been made to rectify financial disorder and to crack down on illegal financial activities in a forceful manner. Unauthorized Internet-based asset management institutions, unauthorized payment institutions, equity crowd-funding platforms, and illegal Internet 鈥渕utual-insurance鈥� platforms have all been cleaned up. All operating peer-to-peer lending institutions have exited from the market. On-shore cryptocurrency trading and financing platforms of initial coin offerings have been closed. Unauthorized on-shore and off-shore online foreign exchange trading platforms have been shut down. A special rectification has been conducted to crack down on illegal fund-raising, and a serious crackdown has been conducted on illegal fund-raising and similar illegal financial activities. Fourth, there has been a sharp decline in shadow banking risks. According to the requirement of 鈥減reventing risks, rectifying disorder, and shoring up weaknesses,鈥� the Guidelines on Regulating the Asset Management Business of Financial Institutions (hereinafter referred to as the Guidelines) and their complementary rules were issued in a timely manner. With the transition period of the Guidelines coming to an end at end-2021 as expected, the scale of asset management products has grown amidst stability, the structure has continuously been optimized, the share of net value-based products has increased by a large margin, and risks have obviously moderated. Joint efforts have been made to rectify financial disorder such as violations of inter-bank business regulations, leverage financing, off-balance-sheet businesses, and arbitrage, as well as diversions from the real economy into the virtual economy. High-risk shadow banking businesses have been continuously dismantled, leading to an obvious decline of risks and hazards resulting from shadow banking. Fifth, risks from external shocks have been dealt with effectively. The capital market has withstood shocks, such as the turbulence of the international financial market and the escalating external pressures on China. At the same time, the reform of fundamental arrangements has continuously been deepened. The coordinated management framework of 鈥渕acro prudential management plus micro regulation鈥� has been continuously improved, and the policy toolkit has been diversified and perfected. Therefore, in the midst of complicated and rapidly changing situations, the stability of the foreign exchange market and the security of the national economy and finance have been effectively safeguarded. Sixth, anti-corruption and rectifying disorder have been closely integrated with risk resolution. The PBC has effectively promoted the establishment of a risk prevention and control mechanism, earnestly held those responsible to account, improved law-based finance, shored up regulatory weaknesses, filled in regulatory gaps, and resolutely investigated and dealt with a number of major cases with adverse influence on the market. As a result, supervisory negligence and criminal behavior hidden behind the financial risks have been seriously punished. As concentrated efforts have been made to fight the tough battle, the prominent risks accumulated in China鈥檚 financial system have been disposed of in an effective manner, and institutional weaknesses have been gradually shored up. The endogenous risks, which are caused by illegal and illegitimate operations of some financial institutions and by the financial sector being distracted from its intended purpose of serving the real economy, have been basically eliminated. Currently, China鈥檚 financial system is healthy and stable overall, with the quality and efficiency of the financial sector serving the real economy further improved. According to the central bank rating of financial institutions in Q3, of over 4,400 banking institutions rated throughout the nation, 4,002 institutions are rated within the safe boundary, with assets accounting for 98.65 percent of the total in the banking industry. In particular, 24 large banks operate in a sound manner, and the quality of their assets is fine. Their assets account for 70 percent of the industry, constituting the steady mainstay of China鈥檚 financial system. It should also be noted that under the impact of COVID-19, as centennial changes are accelerating, the external environment tends to be more complicated and serious, and it faces more uncertainties. China鈥檚 economic development is faced with the triple pressures of shrinking demand, supply shocks, and weakened expectations, and the risk prevention situation is still complicated and serious. Going forward, the PBC must always follow the central and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee on finance, hold steadfast to the fundamental position of people-centered development, understand the new development stage, act on the new development philosophy, and establish a new development paradigm to drive highquality development. It will place emphasis on stabilizing growth and preventing risks, give priority to stability, and pursue progress while ensuring stability. In line with the principles of 鈥渕aintaining overall stability, taking a coordinated approach, adopting differentiated measures, and defusing bombs with precision,鈥� it will adhere to marketoriented and law-based principles, continue to promote recovery amidst operations and to defuse risks through reform, and it will ensure that all concerned parties truly perform their respective duties. It will make the policy adjustments more forward-looking, preemptive, and systematic, actively respond to new situations and challenges, firmly defend the bottom line that no systemic risk should occur, and resolutely maintain the stability of overall economic and social development. Reform of development and policy financial institutions was continuously deepened. The PBC worked to comprehensively implement the reform plans for development and policy financial institutions to redefine their responsibilities and business scope, apply classified accounting, improve corporate governance, strengthen restraint mechanisms, and prevent financial risks. The PBC guided development and policy financial institutions to fulfill their responsibilities, focus on their main businesses, and give full play to their role in supporting economic restructuring and high-quality development on the basis of strengthening risk prevention and control. X. Deepening reform of foreign exchange arrangements Pilot programs for a higher-level opening-up of cross-border trade and investment were conducted in some districts. Currently, based on the approval of the State Council, the SAFE has conducted pilot programs for the higher-level opening-up of cross-border trade and investment in districts such as Lin-gang Special Area of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, Nansha New Zone Area of China (Guangdong) Pilot Free Trade Zone, Yangpu Economic Development Zone of China (Hainan) Pilot Free Trade Zone, and Beilun District of Ningbo Municipality in Zhejiang Province. The pilot policies include nine capital account reform measures, four current account facilitation measures, and two requirements for strengthening risk prevention and control and supervision capacity-building . The regular issuance of the qualified domestic institutional investors (QDII) quota was continuously promoted, with macro prudential management on quota and risk prevention optimized. Sticking to regular and standardized issuances of the QDII quota, the SAFE conducted seven rounds of issuing QDII quotas in 2021, totaling USD40.8 billion to 57 institutions, better satisfying the demand of domestic market entities for cross-border investment. Facilitation of cross-border investment and financing was further promoted, supporting development of the real economy. In October 2021, the Official Reply of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Supporting the Pilot Program of External Debt Facilitation in Chengdu and Chongqing was issued, approving four pilot programs in Chengdu and Chongqing on external debt registration without regional limitations and one-off registration of external debt for non-financial enterprises. Part 3. Financial Market Conditions In 2021, performance of the financial market was generally stable. Money market interest rates remained stable with active market transactions. The bond market featured increased bond issuances and generally declining coupon rates. In general, the stock market index went up, with both turnover and the amount of funds raised witnessing year-on-year increases. I. Financial market overview 1. Money market interest rates remained stable with active market transactions. The money market was generally stable. In December 2021, the monthly weighted average interest rate for interbank lending was 2.02 percent, and the monthly weighted average interest rate of pledged repos posted 2.09 percent, 14 basis points and 10 basis points lower than that in September, respectively. The monthly weighted average interest rate of government-backed bond pledged repos among depository institutions posted 1.94 percent, 12 basis points lower than that in September and 15 basis points lower than the monthly weighted average interest rate of pledged repos in the interbank market. At end-2021 the overnight and 7-day Shibor posted 2.13 percent and 2.27 percent, respectively. Market transactions were active. In 2021, the volume of bond repos trading on the interbank market reached RMB1045.2 trillion, representing an average daily turnover of RMB4.2 trillion, up 8.5 percent year on year. The volume of cumulative trading in interbank lending registered RMB118.8 trillion, with an average daily turnover of RMB475.3 billion and a year-on-year decrease of 19.6 percent. In terms of the maturity structure, overnight repos accounted for 84.4 percent of the total turnover in bond repos, decreasing 0.3 percentage points year on year, and overnight lending constituted 89.2 percent of the interbank lending, down 1.0 percentage point year on year. The volume of bond repos trading on the exchange markets increased 21.9 percent year on year to RMB350 trillion. Interbank Certificates of Deposit (CD) and negotiable CD businesses operated steadily. In 2021, about 30,000 interbank CDs were issued on the interbank market, raising RMB21.8 trillion. The volume of trading on the secondary market totaled RMB154.5 trillion. At end-2021, outstanding interbank CDs reached RMB14.0 trillion. About 54,000 negotiable CDs were issued by financial institutions in 2021, raising RMB11.3 trillion, an increase of RMB1.6 trillion year on year. In 2021, the average weighted interest rate of 3-month interbank CDs was 2.62 percent, 10 basis points higher than that of the 3-month Shibor. Interest rate swap transactions witnessed steady growth. In 2021, the RMB interest rate swap market witnessed 252,000 transactions, decreasing 7.9 percent year on year, with the volume of the notional principal totaling RMB21.1 trillion, an increase of 8.0 percent year on year. In terms of the maturity structure, contracts with maturities of up to one year traded most briskly and the volume of the notional principal posted RMB15.3 trillion, accounting for 72.6 percent of the principal of all maturities. The 7- day fixing repo rate and the Shibor served as the main reference rates for the floating leg of the RMB interest rate swaps, accounting for 86.7 percent and 12.4 percent, respectively, of the total notional principal of the interest rate swaps. In 2021, interest rate swaps anchored to the loan prime rate (LPR) witnessed 919 transactions, with RMB109.83 billion of the notional principal. The LPR interest rate option business developed steadily. Fixing repo rate (FDR) options were newly added to the interbank market on March 29, 2021. In 2021, a total of 390 interest rate option transactions were concluded, totaling RMB75.621 billion. Specifically, 32 were interest rate swap transactions, amounting to RMB1.560 billion of the notional principal, and 358 were interest rate cap/floor transactions, amounting to RMB74.061 billion of the notional principal. 2. Coupon rates of bonds generally declined, while bond issuances expanded On the whole, coupon rates of bonds declined. In December 2021, the yield on 10-year government securities issued by the Ministry of Finance was 2.82 percent, 3 basis points lower than that in September. The coupon rate of 10-year financial bonds issued by the China Development Bank (CDB) was 3.02 percent, 10 basis points lower than the rate in September. The average rate of 1-year short-term financing bills (bond rating A-1) issued by AAA-rated enterprises was 3.07 percent, 79 basis points lower than the rate in September. Government securities yields went down. At end-December 2021, yields on 1-year, 3- year, 7-year, and 10-year government securities decreased by 9 basis points, 5 basis points, 7 basis points, and 7 basis points to 2.24 percent, 2.46 percent, 2.78 percent, and 2.78 percent from end-September, respectively. The term spread between 1-year and 10-year government securities was 53 basis points, narrowing 1 basis point from endSeptember. Credit spreads narrowed, with yield spreads on 3-year AAA and AA-rated short-to-medium-term bills and CDB bonds narrowing by 8 basis points and 4 basis points to 34 basis points and 109 basis points from end-June, respectively. Bond issuances saw year-on-year growth. In 2021, the cumulative value of bond issuances increased by 7.8 percent, or RMB4.4 trillion, year on year to RMB61.4 trillion.

Institutional arrangements in the bond market Institutional arrangements in the bond market were further improved. In April 2021, the PBC released the Announcement No. 4 [2021] of the People鈥檚 Bank of China (Revision of the Announcement on Bond Trading and Circulation on the Interbank Bond Market). The Announcement further improves institutional arrangements and efficiency for bond trading and circulation, thus enhancing the capability of the bond market to serve the real economy. In August, the PBC, NDRC, MOF, CBIRC, and CSRC jointly released the Notice on Promoting the Sound Development of the Credit Rating Business on the Bond Market (Yinfa No.206 [2021]). The Notice improves rating quality and rating differentiation, allowing the credit rating business to better support the sound development of the bond market. In August, the PBC, NDRC, MOF, CBIRC, CSRC, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) jointly released the Guiding Opinions on Advancing the Reform, Opening-Up, and HighQuality Development of the Corporate Credit Bond Market (Yinfa No.217 [2021]). The Guiding Opinions aim to improve the legal system for the bond market and to build a multi-tiered bond market system featuring robust regulation, orderly competition, transparency, and openness. The high-level two-way opening-up of China鈥檚 bond market pressed ahead in a steady manner. In September 2021, the PBC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) jointly announced the launch of Southbound Trading under the mutual bond market access and connection scheme between the Mainland and Hong Kong (hereinafter referred to as the 鈥淪outhbound Bond Connect鈥�). In the same month, the PBC released the Notice of the PBC on Launching Southbound Trading under the Mutual Bond Market Access between the Mainland and Hong Kong. In October, FTSE Russell added Chinese government bonds to its World Government Bond Index (WGBI). So far, all three major global bond index providers have included Chinese bonds in their major indexes, which fully reflects the confidence that international investors have in the longterm sound development of China鈥檚 economy and in China鈥檚 commitment to a further opening-up of its financial markets. The opening-up of the financial markets helps China achieve high-quality economic growth and enables global investors to share China鈥檚 economic achievements. In December, to deepen the reform of 鈥渟treamlining administration, delegating powers, improving regulation and services,鈥� further unify and regulate the management framework for bond issuances in overseas jurisdictions by domestic financial institutions, and enhance the convenience and flexibility of issuing bonds overseas, the PBC and the NDRC jointly repealed the Interim Measures for the Administration of the Issuance of RMB Bonds in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by Domestic Financial Institutions (Announcement No. 12 [2007] of the PBC and NDRC). The repeal of the Interim Measures will not affect the issuance of RMB and foreign currency-denominated bonds in Hong Kong and other countries (regions) by domestic financial institutions. In fact, the issuance procedures were improved and became more convenient, allowing issuers to choose the issuing regions and time windows within approved quotas at their discretion. 2. Reform and institutional arrangements in the securities market The capital market reform was deepened comprehensively. The Guangzhou Futures Exchange was launched in January 2021, aiming to serve the real economy and green development as well as the building of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road. On April 6, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange officially merged its main and SME boards, creating a new development paradigm featuring diversified yet complementary boards. In April, China鈥檚 first special representative litigation case of a securities dispute made its debut, which was significant for protecting the legitimate rights and interests of investors and boosting the sound development of the capital market. On November 15, the Beijing Stock Exchange started trading. Focusing on serving innovative SMEs, it further improved the multilayered capital market system.Institutional arrangements for capital market regulation were improved. In January 2021, the CSRC released the Provisions on Strengthening Regulation of Private Equity Investment Funds, which reiterated and detailed the regulations over the bottom lines in the operation of private equity funds to regulate development of the industry. In February, the CSRC released the Guidelines for the Application of Regulatory Rules -- Concerning Disclosure of Information by Shareholders of Companies Applying for IPO. The Guidelines tighten regulation over behavior such as sudden buying before the listing, abnormal buying prices, tunneling, and 鈥渟hadow shareholders,鈥� and targeting illegal 鈥渞ags to riches.鈥� In July, the General Offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council released the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities in Accordance with the Law. The Opinions consolidate a law-based and integrity-based capital market and help to create a favorable market ecology that upholds laws and honors commitments. 3. Institutional arrangements in the insurance market The insurance industry was opened up further. In March 2021, the CBIRC revised and released the Implementation Rules of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Foreign-funded Insurance Companies and removed the clauses concerning foreign ownership limits on joint-venture life insurance companies to maintain consistency among the relevant institutional systems. Meanwhile, it further elaborated on the entry criteria for foreign insurance group companies and for foreign financial institutions to invest in foreign-funded insurance companies. Supplementary improvements were made to clarify the requirements for market access and for changes of shareholders in foreign-funded insurance companies, relevant management systems for domestic insurance group companies, security reviews of foreign investment, etc. An exclusive commercial pension insurance pilot was launched. In May 2021, the CBIRC released the Notice on Exclusive Commercial Pension Insurance Pilots and it decided to launch an exclusive commercial pension insurance pilot in Zhejiang Province (including Ningbo City) and Chongqing Municipality for one year starting on June 1, 2021. PICC Life Insurance Company Limited and five other life insurance companies were to carry out the pilot work. The Notice specifies the methods of payment, design of the accumulation period and claiming period, the insurance liabilities, rules for insurance cancellation, information disclosures, and product management. It also clarifies the regulatory support policies with respect to equity asset allocations and the minimum capital requirement. Regulation of the solvency of insurance companies was strengthened. In January 2021, the CBIRC revised and released the Regulations on Solvency Management of Insurance Companies. The Regulations, with a risk-oriented approach, specify regulatory rules of solvency that integrate quantitative capital requirements, qualitative regulatory requirements, and market discipline mechanisms, thus making clear the three-pillar framework of solvency regulation. In December, the CBIRC released the Solvency Regulatory Rules II for Insurance Companies, which guide the insurance industry to return to its safeguarding role and to focus on its main businesses, enhance its capability to serve the real economy, and effectively prevent risks in the insurance sector. Part 4. Macroeconomic Overview I. Global economic and financial developments Disrupted by the resurgence of COVID-19, the global economic recovery has slowed down since the second half of 2021. Supply-chain bottlenecks have not yet eased, overseas inflationary pressures have increased, and labor markets in the advanced economies have seen structural shifts. Looking ahead, COVID-19, inflation, and macro policy adjustments in the advanced economies remain highly uncertain. Potential economic and financial risks arising from such uncertainties should not be neglected. 1. Economic performance and financial markets in the major economies The global resurgence of COVID-19 cases has disrupted the economic recovery. Omicron, the new variant, is still spreading throughout the world. Daily confirmed new cases globally peaked at nearly 4 million since January 2022. At one time, daily new cases exceeded 1 million in the U.S. The resurgence of COVID-19 has persistently prolonged supply-chain strains and amplified uncertainties related to the global economic recovery. In December 2021, the PMI in the U.S., the euro area, and Japan was 58.7, 58, and 54.3, respectively, down 2.4 percentage points, 0.4 percentage points, and 0.2 percentage points from the previous month. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have recently revised downward their global growth forecasts for 2022. Using the composite leading indicator, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has concluded that growth rates in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and the UK may have peaked at end-2021. Commodity prices surged, while inflation in the advanced economies increased. Factors such as extreme weather and geopolitical tensions continued to push up oil and gas prices. In January 2022, the price of Brent Crude Oil Futures rose above USD90 a barrel, a new high since October 2014. The price of natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange was once above USD6.3 per million British thermal units, a record high since April 2010. Inflation went up in the advanced economies. In December 2021, the CPI was up by 7 percent year on year in the U.S., a new high since 1982. The HICP rose by 5 percent in the euro area. Inflation also remained elevated in the emerging economies. In December, the IPCA in Brazil and the CPI in Russia were up by 10.1 percent and 8.4 percent year on year, respectively. The labor shortage has worsened in the advanced economies where the labor market has seen structural changes. The unemployment rate in the major advanced economies moved closer to pre-COVID-19 levels, while the labor participation rate remained low, resulting in an insufficient labor supply. First, people are less willing to work. The elderly have retired early due to health concerns, women have quit their jobs to take care of their families, and young people have adopted a wait-and-see attitude without any imminent need to look for jobs. There was a wave of many resignations in the U.S. where a new record high of 4.5 million people resigned in November 2021, and job vacancies remained above 10 million for six consecutive months. Second, massive fiscal subsidies in response to COVID-19 are a disincentive to work. This is more salient in the U.S., as direct subsidies to households and individuals are higher in the U.S. than in Europe. Third, trade unions have grown more powerful in some countries. They have stronger bargaining power, demanding higher wages and better compensation. Global financial markets were more volatile. The resurgence of COVID-19, the economic slowdown, and rising inflation have made investors more sensitive, leading to larger fluctuations in the capital markets. The major stock indices in the advanced economies began a downward correction in September and November 2021 and January 2022. In the meantime, driven by expectations of a monetary policy shift and growing risk aversion, the U.S. Dollar Index and the yields on U.S. Treasuries moved upwards. From end-August to end-December 2021, the U.S. Dollar Index rose from below 93 to near 96. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries edged up from 1.3 percent to 1.52 percent and recently even further to above 2 percent, higher than the pre-COVID level at end-2019.2. Monetary policies in the major economies The major advanced economies sped up their monetary policy shifts. The Federal Reserve accelerated monetary policy tightening. It reduced asset purchases by USD15 billion in November and December 2021, and by USD30 billion per month starting from January 2022 (USD20 billion for Treasury securities and USD10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities), bringing them to an end in March 2022. The Federal Reserve indicated in January 2022 that a rate hike would soon be appropriate and it would start to reduce the size of the balance sheet faster and more significantly than in the previous cycle after the first rate hike. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced in December 2021 that it would slow the pace of net purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) and discontinue them at the end of March 2022. Its Governing Council decided to increase monthly net purchases from EUR20 billion to EUR40 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and to EUR30 billion in the third quarter under the asset purchase program (APP). From October 2022 onwards, it will maintain net asset purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of EUR20 billion and it expects net purchases to end shortly before raising the key interest rates. The Bank of England raised the rate by an unexpected 15 basis points (bps) to 0.25 percent in December 2021 and raised it further by 25 bps to 0.5 percent in February 2022. It also decided to start reducing its balance sheet. The Bank of Japan will end additional purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds by end-March 2022 as scheduled to allow its holdings to gradually fall back to the pre-COVID level of about JPY5 trillion. Among other central banks, the Bank of Korea, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and the Norges Bank all raised rates twice in 2021, each by a total of 50 bps. The Bank of Canada put an end to quantitative easing, while the Reserve Bank of Australia cut the size of bond purchases and exited yield curve control. Several emerging economies raised interest rates a number of times. To address inflationary pressures, capital outflows, and currency depreciations, the major emerging economies hiked rates several times in 2021. The central banks of Brazil and Russia both increased their rates seven times by a total of 725 bps and 425 bps, respectively, the Bank of Mexico raised its rate five times by a total of 150 bps, and the South African Reserve Bank hiked its rate once by 25 bps. 3. Issues that merit attention COVID-19 remains a major variable in global economic and financial developments. Given possible virus variants and the spread of Omicron in several places, the global path of COVID-19 is highly uncertain. In the short term, disruptions from COVID-19 will weigh down on the recovery of production and supply, which will slow down the global economic recovery. In the medium and long term, the persistence of COVID-19 will not only widen the gap among different economies, industries, businesses, and income groups but will also undermine human capital accumulation and labor supply, as some people may be forced to leave the labor force permanently due to limited access to education, leaving a scarring effect on long-term global growth. The macro policy shift in the major advanced economies is a huge external uncertainty in 2022. On the monetary policy front, the central banks in most advanced economies have changed their policy stance. The Federal Reserve鈥檚 policy shift of 鈥渞educing bond purchases 鈥� raising interest rates 鈥� shrinking balance sheets鈥� is clear and its tightening statement exceeds market expectations. The Bank of England has successively hiked the rate twice, and the ECB has also announced that the pace of bond purchases would be slowed down. On the fiscal policy front, the IMF forecast that the fiscal deficit in the U.S., the euro area, Japan, and the UK would drop from 10.8 percent, 7.7 percent, 9.0 percent, and 11.9 percent in 2021 to 6.9 percent, 3.4 percent, 3.9 percent, and 5.6 percent in 2022, respectively. Marginal convergence has become a prominent feature in the countries鈥� fiscal policies. It should be noted that global financial vulnerabilities have increased since the outbreak of COVID-19 amid rapidly rising asset prices and higher debts. Therefore, a policy exit in the advanced economies may not only trigger large asset-price corrections but also bring spillovers to the emerging economies through trade, capital flows, financial markets, and other channels. Properly addressing potential risks requires stronger international coordination. There remain disputes over how long high inflation will persist, and the deanchoring of inflation expectations should be avoided. The COVID-induced supplychain bottlenecks and disruptions, the wage-price spiral caused by structural labor shortages, the rising commodity prices and their pass-through effects, and the ultraloose monetary policy in the advanced economies have all contributed to a sharp increase in overseas inflation. How these factors will evolve and when their impact will recede remain highly uncertain. At present, inflation expectations in the advanced economies are still elevated even though inflationary pressures have already reached highs that have rarely been seen in years. Policy makers need to watch closely the risk of de-anchoring and prevent inflation from spreading. II. Macroeconomic developments in China In 2021, though facing the changes unseen in a century, severe COVID-19 around the world and complex and complicated situations at home and abroad, China鈥檚 economy sustained a steady recovery, new achievements were made in high-quality development, and the 14th Five-Year Plan achieved a good start.

The core CPI (food and energy excluded) rose moderately by 0.8 percent year on year, on par with the previous year. Producer prices witnessed a remarkable rise. Due to the tight supply of global energy and raw materials, the prices of major commodities soared in 2021, driving the domestic Producer Prices Index (PPI) to surge. The PPI increased 8.1 percent year on year, accelerating by 9.9 percentage points from that in 2020. During the three months of Q4, the PPI increased 13.5 percent, 12.9 percent, and 10.3 percent year on year, respectively, representing a downward trend from the peak.

Second-hand residential housing prices increased by 1.0 percent year on year, decelerating by 1.1 percentage points from the previous year. In 2021, total floor area of sold units increased by 1.9 percent year on year, registering an average growth of 2.3 percent during the past two years. Housing sales increased by 4.8 percent year on year, registering an average growth of 6.7 percent during the past two years. Investments in real estate development grew by 4.4 percent year on year, registering an average growth of 5.7 percent during the past two years. Specifically, investments in residential housing development rose by 6.4 percent year on year, registering an average growth of 7.0 percent during the past two years and accounting for 75.3 percent of total investments in real estate development. On the whole, growth of real estate loans remained stable. At end-2021, outstanding real estate loans by major financial institutions (including foreign-funded financial institutions) grew by 7.9 percent year on year to RMB52.2 trillion, a deceleration of 3.7 percentage points from end-2020. Specifically, outstanding individual housing loans grew by 11.3 percent year on year to RMB38.3 trillion, a deceleration of 3.3 percentage points from end-2020. Outstanding housing development loans grew by 0.5 percent year on year to RMB9.1 trillion, a deceleration of 7.7 percentage points from end-2020. 7.2 The automobile industry In 2021, the automobile industry in China rose to the challenges triggered by COVID- 19 and the supply-chain shocks such as the chip shortage. In general, the automobile industry operated smoothly with the following characteristics. First, both production and sales maintained steady growth. In 2021, the volume of automobile production and sales reached 26.082 million and 26.275 million, respectively, increasing by 3.4 percent and 3.8 percent year on year, respectively. Second, profitability remained relatively stable. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in 2021 revenue in the automobile manufacturing industry rose by 6.7 percent year on year. Total profits, even with the increased raw material prices, still expanded by 1.9 percent. Third, the rapid growth in automobile exports continued. In 2021, a total of 2.015 million automobiles were exported, a rise of 101.1 percent from 2020. Fourth, production and sales of new energy vehicles surged. In 2021, the volume of new energy vehicle production and sales both increased by 160 percent year on year to 3.545 million and 3.521 million, respectively, accounting for 13.4 percent of market share. However, as COVID-19 resurged globally and repeatedly, chip shortages posed a significant threat to production chains in the automobile industry in the following respects. First, affected by the COVID-19 disruption and several events in chip production areas such as the earthquake in Japan and the blizzard in Texas, major chip producers in the world faced reduced production to varying degrees or even halted production. Even though some producers, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, announced plans to expand production, it still took time for the extra chips to be manufactured. Second, a variety of chips is needed for a finished automobile. Although manufacturers proactively purchased chips, there were serious structural mismatches in the various chips required for automobile manufacturing. Third, development of the stay-at-home economy sped up against the backdrop of COVID-19, so the demand for chips for electronics and smart products grew. This squeezed some production capacity of automotive chips to deliver lower profits. The chip shortage is forecast to likely last until the second half of 2022. Coupled with the said issues, China鈥檚 automobile industry faces some other challenges in the 鈥�14th Five-Year Plan鈥� period. For one thing, the new energy technology is yet to be mature, so the green and low-carbon transition faces great pressures. The costs for a finished new energy vehicle are still too high. The industry faces problems such as a lack of security, practicability, and facility in its overall development as well as a shortage of raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. While carbon emissions are remarkably lower from driving electric vehicles, they remain high in the production process. For another, the trade of automobiles lacks efficiency. There are still noticeable disparities between mature international automobile markets and China鈥檚 automobile markets, including the markets of new automobiles, second-hand automobiles, scrapped automobiles, and the automobile aftermarket. According to the statistics of Verband der Automobilindustrie (VDA), in 2021 the ratio of the volume of second-hand automobile trade to that of new automobile trade in China was only one-sixth of that in the U.S. The automobile industry is one of the pillars of the economy and because its carbon emissions account for 7.5 percent of total carbon emissions in China, it remains a focus for achieving the carbon emissions peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. Moving forward, following the Mid-to Long-term Development Plan for the Automobile Industry and the Development Plan for the New Energy Vehicle Industry (2021-2035), China鈥檚 automobile industry will develop in a high-quality and sustainable manner with the following measures. First, the supply-chain system will be built, improved, and elevated to shore up the weak link in chips. Technology, as the key, will be emphasized. The country will hasten the pace of researching and developing critical technologies such as automotive chips, and it will guide enterprises to upgrade their supply-chain arrangements to enhance stability, security, and competitiveness. Second, research and development for new energy technology will accelerate with coordinated arrangements for carbon emissions reductions in all links. More resources will be channeled to researching and developing core technologies like fuel cells and intelligent connected vehicles. Also, the supply of raw materials as well as new materials and appliances will be secured further. The development and application of new materials and devices will be improved. Third, China will pick up speed in boosting intelligent manufacturing, diversifying transportation services, greening the life cycle of automobile products, and building a new ecological system for the automobile industry characterized by full connectedness, good coordination, high efficiency, situational awareness, and intelligent decisions. Part 5. Monetary Policy Outlook I锛嶰utlook for the Chinese economy The year 2021 is a milestone in the history of China and the Communist Party of China (CPC). We celebrated the 100th anniversary of the CPC, accomplished the first Centennial Goal, and started the march toward our second centenary. Facing COVID- 19, changes unseen in a century as well as complex domestic and global situations, China maintained a leading status in both economic growth and COVID-19 control under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core. GDP in China in 2021 recorded year-on-year growth of 8.1 percent, contributing about 25 percent to global economic growth. Per capita GDP reached USD12,500. In addition, the CPI grew 0.9 percent year on year, and the newlyemployed urban population reached 12.69 million, achieving an optimized combination of relatively high growth, low inflation, and high employment. With new progress in high-quality development, the 14th Five-Year Plan opened to a good start. The Chinese economy recovered and stabilized in Q4 2021. GDP grew 4.0 percent year on year, averaging 5.2 percent for the past two years and rising 0.3 percentage points from Q3. Agriculture in Q4 maintained rapid growth, the industrial sector continued to grow, and the service sector steadily recovered. Residential income was basically in line with economic growth, and consumption potential continued to accumulate. The structure of fixed-asset investments improved, while manufacturing and high-tech industries were a prominent force driving investment. Exports witnessed strong momentum and a growing share of the global market. Employment was stable overall, and support for the people鈥檚 livelihood was effective. The sound monetary policy was flexible, targeted, reasonable, and appropriate. Priority was given to intertemporal adjustments and cross-year policy arrangements. Monetary policy was more forward-looking, stable, targeted, effective, and independent. Money and credit maintained steady growth. Rates on corporate loans were the lowest since the reform and opening-up was introduced more than forty years ago. The financial sector continued to provide solid support for the real economy. Meanwhile, a deluge of strong stimulus was avoided, and the macro leverage ratio dropped for a fifth consecutive quarter. The RMB exchange rate remained basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level, playing the role of an auto stabilizer for the macro economy and the balance of payments. However, it should be noted that the Chinese economy is facing combined pressures from shrinking demand, supply shocks, and waning expectations, and the external environment is becoming more serious and complex with increased uncertainties. COVID-19, inflation, and the policy adjustments of the advanced economies are the three major sources of uncertainty. The Omicron variant spread rapidly in Europe, America, and other countries. The highest number of daily global cases approached four million. The IMF and the World Bank lowered growth projections for 2022 as the global economic outlook became uncertain. Inflation is rising in the major advanced economies, and supply bottlenecks have not been resolved. As the Federal Reserve expressed that it would raise interest rates and shrink its balance sheet, the market expects a faster tightening of its policy, thereby increasing the risks related to global capital flows and financial market adjustments. The domestic economy faces downward pressures as COVID-19 unfolds with uncertainty and therefore suppresses consumption. In addition, investments in some sectors have not bottomed out, and there are medium-to long-term challenges including slower potential economic growth and population growth, and the low-carbon transition. In response, it is necessary to remain confident while being aware of the difficulties. The fundamentals for long-term steady growth are unchanged, and the favorable conditions for building a new development paradigm are unchanged. Therefore, the PBC will focus on fulfilling its responsibilities to achieve high-quality development. Inflation pressures are generally controllable. The CPI in 2021 averaged 0.9 percent. Its average range in the next stage will likely rise moderately from the past year and continue to fit within a reasonable range. Meanwhile, year-on-year PPI growth dropped after a temporary surge. The global supply-demand gap will likely close up in the coming stage. Combined with a gradually emerging high-base effect, PPI growth in 2022 is expected to continue to decline. Overall, supply and demand in the Chinese economy are basically stable. The PBC is carrying out a normal monetary policy, which will help price movements to remain stable for the medium and long term.II. Outlook for monetary policy in the next stage In the next stage, continuing to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the PBC will implement the guidelines made at the 19th CPC National Congress, the plenary sessions of the 19th CPC Central Committee, and the Central Economic Work Conference. In line with the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, it will apply the new development philosophy fully, faithfully, and comprehensively, deepen the supplyside structural reform, accelerate the building of a new development paradigm, build a modern central banking system, improve the modern monetary policy framework, and promote high-quality development. Adhering to the principle of giving top priority to stability while pursuing progress, the PBC will take active measures to implement the guidelines of the Central Economic Work Conference. It will step up financial support for the real economy and continue to do its part well in ensuring stability on six fronts, namely, employment, the financial sector, foreign trade, foreign investment, domestic investment, and expectations, and in maintaining security in six areas, namely, employment, people's basic livelihood, operations of market entities, food and energy security, stable industrial and supply chains, and the normal functioning of primarylevel governments. Striving to maintain macroeconomic stability, the PBC will create a favorable monetary and financial environment to keep economic indicators within a reasonable range and to gear up for the opening of the 20th CPC National Congress. The PBC will pursue a sound monetary policy that is flexible and appropriate, strengthen intertemporal adjustments, and give proper play to the dual role of monetary policy tools in both aggregate and structural terms. Placing emphasis on the adequacy, targetedness, and foresightedness of policy measures, it will meet the reasonable and bona fide financing demands of the real economy while refraining from adopting a deluge of strong stimulus measures, and it will focus on stepping up financial support for key fields and weak links to achieve both stable aggregates and an optimal structure. The first aim is to maintain stable growth in monetary and credit aggregates. The PBC will improve the mechanism for money supply management, keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level, guide financial institutions to vigorously increase credit supply, and make the growth of credit aggregates more stable. With these efforts, it is expected that the growth rates of money supply and aggregate financing to the real economy (AFRE) will continue to be basically in line with nominal economic growth and that the macro leverage ratio will remain basically stable. The second aim is to steadily optimize the credit structure. Structural monetary policy tools will be used actively to provide additional support as needed. The PBC will put into operation the market-oriented policy tools supporting micro and small businesses (MSBs), and it will make effective use of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Facility as well as targeted central bank lending for clean and efficient use of coal. Financial institutions will be guided to ramp up credit supply to regions with slow credit growth and to intensify targeted support for MSBs, sci-tech innovation, green development, and other key fields as well as weak links. The third aim is to bring down the overall financing costs for businesses. The PBC will enhance the market-oriented interest rate formation and transmission mechanism by tapping into the loan prime rate (LPR) reform, stabilizing bank liability costs, and guiding loan rates for businesses to move downwards. The fourth aim is to keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. Focusing on domestic conditions and based on market supply and demand, the PBC will enhance RMB exchange rate flexibility and bring into play the role of the exchange rate in macroeconomic management and as an automatic stabilizer for the balance of payments. It will strengthen macro-prudential management of cross-border capital flows, stress expectation management, guide market entities to be risk-neutral, and properly balance internal and external equilibria. In the meantime, the PBC will uphold bottom-line thinking, enhance systemic awareness, and make coordinated efforts to forestall and defuse major financial risks based on market principles and the rule of law. First, the PBC will maintain reasonable growth in money and credit. It will keep a close watch on marginal changes in the economic and financial situations at home and abroad while reinforcing monitoring and analysis of uncertainties, such as fiscal revenue and expenditures, issuances of government bonds, cash injections and withdrawals, and monetary policy adjustments made by the major economies. A mix of monetary policy tools will be used to keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level and to guide market rates to move around the policy rates. The PBC will improve the mechanism for money supply management, continue to ease liquidity, capital, and interest rate constraints on bank credit supply, cultivate and stimulate credit demand from the real economy, guide financial institutions to vigorously increase credit supply, and make the growth of credit aggregates more stable so that the growth rates of money supply and the AFRE will be basically in line with nominal economic growth. It will improve the mechanism for sustainable capital replenishment by replenishing capital for commercial banks through multiple channels and stepping up support for small and medium-sized banks in their issuance of perpetual bonds and other capital replenishment instruments, thereby improving the capacity of banks to serve the real economy and to forestall and defuse financial risks. Second, the PBC will continue to bring into play the guiding role of structural monetary policy tools. It will keep central bank lending and discount policies stable to carry on inclusive and sustained funding support for agro-related businesses, MSBs, and private enterprises while guiding financial institutions to increase credit supply to regions with slow credit growth. The PBC will implement the arrangements for the conversion of the two monetary policy tools providing direct support for the real economy, intensify financial support for MSBs, and make continued efforts to increase the volume, lower the prices, and expand the coverage of inclusive loans to MSBs so that they can play a bigger role in stabilizing businesses and safeguarding employment. Effective steps will be taken to put into operation the Carbon Emissions Reduction Facility as well as targeted central bank lending for clean and efficient use of coal. Eligible financial institutions will be encouraged to lend at preferential interest rates to key projects that significantly reduce carbon emissions. Moreover, the PBC will support clean and efficient use of coal as well as coal-fired power and will promote the transition to a green and low-carbon economy while ensuring a secure energy supply. Third, the PBC will build the systems and mechanisms needed to provide effective financial support for the real economy. It will strengthen capacity building to improve financial services for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and will guide financial institutions to continue ramping up their issuances of first-time loans, renewed loans and unsecured loans, aiming to set up a long-term mechanism whereby banks will have the confidence, willingness, ability, and professionalism to provide loans. It will increase the availability of supply-chain financing to MSMEs and improve the supporting mechanisms for MSME financing. With more work to be done to consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty eradication, the PBC will promote financial support for the development of the seed industry, new types of agribusinesses, agricultural and rural infrastructure development, and other key fields, and it will guide financial institutions to come up with innovative services and products in order to better meet the diversified financing needs of agro-related businesses. Firmly adhering to the principle that housing is for living in, not for speculation, and that the real estate market shall not be used to provide a short-term stimulus to the economy, the PBC will remain committed to stabilizing land prices, housing prices, and expectations and to implementing the regulations on prudential management of real estate finance. It will increase financial support for the rental of housing, protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers in the market, better meet the reasonable housing needs of home buyers, and promote the healthy development of the real estate market to foster a virtuous circle. Fourth, the PBC will deepen the market-oriented interest rate and exchange rate reforms to smooth the channels of monetary policy transmission. It will enhance the market-oriented interest rate formation and transmission mechanism by improving the central bank policy rate system and guiding market rates to move around the policy rates. The PBC will tap into the LPR reform and give full play to its role in optimizing resource allocations. It will push financial institutions by market means to allocate more financial resources to MSBs so that competition will rise in the MSB loan market and the overall financing costs for MSBs will stabilize and fall. By encouraging the implementation of measures to improve the oversight of deposit rates, the PBC will regulate competition in the deposit market, stabilize bank liability costs, guide loan rates for businesses to move downwards, and be committed to reducing the overall financing costs for businesses. Taking steady steps to deepen the market-oriented exchange rate reform, the PBC will improve the managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, enhance the RMB exchange rate flexibility, and bring into play the role of the exchange rate in macroeconomic management and as an automatic stabilizer for the balance of payments. Furthermore, it will strengthen expectation management and keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. The PBC will continue to develop the foreign exchange market. Guiding both enterprises and financial institutions to be risk-neutral, it will offer guidance to financial institutions on providing services of exchange rate risk hedging for the MSMEs with authentic needs based on a risk-neutral concept, on reducing the costs of exchange rate risk hedging for the MSMEs, and on strengthening risk management of their foreign exchange businesses, thereby maintaining the stable and sound development of the foreign exchange market. The PBC will continue to advance RMB internationalization stably and prudently by further expanding use of the RMB in cross-border trade and investment, deepening international monetary cooperation, and developing offshore RMB markets. In addition, it will conduct pilot projects for the high-quality opening-up of cross-border trade and investment, further liberalize and facilitate cross-border trade and investment, and steadily move ahead with the convertibility of the RMB under the capital account. Fifth, the PBC will make continued efforts to deepen financial reform, and it will accelerate steps to move ahead with financial market institutional building. Focusing on strengthening corporate governance, it will deepen the reform of large commercial banks and establish a modern financial enterprise system with Chinese characteristics. The reform of development financial institutions and policy financial institutions will continue, whereby they will be required to carry out category-based management of businesses and separate accounting, to strengthen capital constraints as well as risk management, to enhance incentives, and to fulfill their responsibilities. In this way, they will better play their roles in serving the real economy and supporting national strategies. The PBC will optimize the administrative framework for the issuance of financial bonds and steadily promote the higher-quality opening-up of the bond market. It will also enhance the efficiency and interconnectivity of the multi-tiered market system and cultivate diversified and qualified investors. More work will be done to improve the legal system for the bond market, to tighten requirements for information disclosures, and to strengthen regulation over intermediary institutions. Meanwhile, the PBC will act in a timely way to forestall and defuse bond market risks. Based on market principles and the rule of law, it will see to it that all concerned parties fulfill their responsibilities. It will continue to put into practice the newly formed mechanisms for bond default resolution, improve the mechanism for unified law enforcement, and crack down on illegal and irregular conduct in the bond market. Sixth, the PBC will improve the systems of financial risk prevention, early warning, resolution, and accountability, and it will build a long-term mechanism to forestall and defuse financial risks. Further steps will be taken to improve the macro-prudential management system as well as the capacity for systemic risk monitoring, assessment, and early warning. The PBC will strengthen regulation over systemically important financial institutions and will pick up pace in pushing China鈥檚 global systemically important banks to establish a sound long-term mechanism for the management of total loss-absorbing capacity and to effectively enhance their risk prevention abilities. It will give further play to the role of deposit insurance as a platform for market-oriented resolution while exploring a number of market-oriented and law-based approaches to support small and medium-sized banks in defusing risks and replenishing capital. The PBC will accelerate its work to improve the system of modern financial regulations, act quickly to shore up the weaknesses in the regulatory framework, and strengthen regulation over financial holding companies. Continuing to follow the principles of 鈥渕aintaining overall stability, making coordinated efforts, taking different approaches based on different conditions, and defusing bombs with precision,鈥� it will resolve the risks of institutions of concern in a prudent and orderly manner, improve regulatory coordination, and contain any possible resurgence of risks. The PBC will work to ensure that all concerned parties fulfill their respective responsibilities, and it will promote a mechanism for fiscal and financial risk resolution led by major local officials in order to join efforts in risk resolution. It will also improve the mechanism for financial risk accountability to hold to account those responsible for major financial risks and to effectively prevent moral hazards.
