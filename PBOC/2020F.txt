Part 1. Money and Credit Analysis In 2020, facing the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, the PBC adopted a two-pronged approach to coordinating pandemic containment with economic and social development. The sound monetary policy is being pursued with more flexibility and appropriateness to guide the stable growth of monetary and credit supply, continuous optimization of the credit structure, and a significant decline in financing costs, thus cushioning the economy from the effects of the pandemic. I. Liquidity in the banking system was adequate at a reasonable level In Q1 2020, in accordance with the requirement that sound monetary policies should be more flexible and appropriate, the PBC intensified countercyclical adjustments and employed a monetary policy toolkit that included RRR cuts and the medium-term lending facility (MLF) to release medium and long-term liquidity. Open market operations were conducted flexibly to maintain adequate liquidity in the banking system at a reasonable level. The PBC also guided a steady decline in money market interest rates and smoothed operations in the financial market. At the end of March, the excess reserve ratio for financial institutions registered 2.1 percent, up 0.8 percentage points from the previous year. II. Lending by financial institutions grew relatively rapidly, with lending rates moving downwards Lending grew relatively rapidly, providing stronger support for the real economy. Multiple measures were taken to encourage financial institutions to enhance credit support for pandemic containment and resumption of work and production. In particular, the role of the loan prime rate (LPR) was brought into play in guiding an overall decline in market interest rates, to stimulate effective demands for credit, and to promote the rapid growth of loans. At the end of March, outstanding loans by financial institutions in domestic and foreign currencies grew 12.3 percent year on year to RMB166 trillion, up RMB7.4 trillion from the beginning of the year and an acceleration of RMB1.3 trillion from the corresponding period of the previous year. Outstanding RMBdenominated loans grew 12.7 percent year on year to RMB160.2 trillion, up RMB7.1 trillion from the beginning of the year and an acceleration of RMB1.3 trillion from the corresponding period of 2019. The credit structure was optimized, and loans to micro and small businesses (MSBs) increased rapidly. Loans to enterprises and public entities grew by RMB6 trillion from the beginning of the year, a year-on-year increase of RMB1.6 trillion. Industries engaged in pandemic containment or heavily hit by the pandemic received strong credit support. The growth of loans to public health and social services reached 17.1 percent, rising 7.2 percentage points year on year. Medium and long-term loans to the manufacturing sector gained 16.7 percent, hitting a new record since April 2011. In particular, loans to the high-tech manufacturing sector rose by 39.2 percent over the same period of the previous year. At the end of March, outstanding inclusive loans to MSBs grew by 23.6 percent year on year to RMB12.4 trillion, up 4.5 percentage points from the same period of the previous year, thus supporting 27.87 million MSBs, a yearon-year increase of 22.2 percent. The growth of loans to the household sector slowed down to 13.7 percent at the end of March, 1.8 percentage points lower than that at end- 2019.Box 1 Smoother Transmission of Monetary Policy to the Real Economy in China In recent years, following the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has used banks as the crux of monetary policy transmission. It has flexibly adopted various measures to alleviate the “three constraints” faced by banks in creation of money, namely, liquidity, capital, and interest rates, in an attempt to straighten out the monetary policy transmission mechanism. From 2018 to April 2020, the PBC cut the required reserve ratio (RRR) ten times, releasing long-term funds in the amount of RMB8.4 trillion. The average RRR fell from 14.9 percent from early 2018 to 9.4 percent. During the first two working days after this year’s Spring Festival, beyond expectations the PBC injected RMB1.7 trillion of short-term liquidity, keeping liquidity adequate at a reasonable level. From 2019 to April 2020, banks issued perpetual bonds totaling RMB718.6 billion, effectively replenishing their tier-one capital. Since August 2019, the LPR reform has been successfully promoted, which has removed the implicit floor for loan rates and has activated the demand for loans. With the “three constraints” eased remarkably, the transmission mechanism of China’s monetary policy is much smoother and transmission efficiency has obviously improved. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the PBC has rolled out a series of monetary policy measures in accordance with the periodic features of pandemic containment and the resumption of work and production. As the transmission efficiency of monetary policy is obviously enhanced, the transmission of various kinds of monetary policy measures to the real economy has been straightened out, which has effectively supported pandemic containment and resumption of work and production, and has alleviated the real difficulties in the real economy. In terms of guiding credit supply, in Q1 the PBC released long-term liquidity in the amount of about RMB2 trillion through RRR cuts and central bank lending. New RMB loans totaled RMB7.1 trillion. For liquidity injection per yuan, there is a corresponding credit growth of 3.5 yuan, which means the amplification ratio is 1:3.5. Deposits are a major component of the broad money (M2), created by credit expansion. The increase in credit supply is accompanied by an increase in deposits by enterprises and residents, which can effectively ease their cash flow pressures and help enterprises alleviate their urgent difficulties in terms of debt repayment, capital turnover, and fund-raising. In terms of reducing the lending rates, enterprise loan rate in March was 4.82 percent, down by 0.3 percentage points from end-2019 and 0.78 percentage points from the peak in 2018 respectively. This drop apparently surpasses those of the one-year MLF and the LPR during the same period. The effect of the policy rate decline is amplified and then transmitted to the real economy, and the LPR reform has effectively played a role in bringing down the lending rates. Since March, in order to offset the impact of COVID-19, central banks in the US and the Eurozone have swiftly cut their interest rates to zero, put forward large-scale asset purchase plans, and even carried out unlimited quantitative easing. In terms of guiding the credit supply, the Federal Reserve released liquidity in the amount of USD1.6 trillion, with loans increasing by USD500 billion. One dollar’s worth of liquidity injection corresponds to credit growth of USD0.3. In Q1, the European Central Bank released liquidity of about EUR540 billion, with loans increasing by EUR230 billion. One euro’s worth of liquidity injection corresponds to credit growth of EUR0.4, which means the reduction ratio is 2.5:1. In terms of reducing lending rates, since 2020 the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by 1.5 percentage points. The average lending rate for the four major US banks, namely, Citibank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan, was 4.96 percent in Q1, decreasing 0.17 percentage points from Q4 2019, and obviously lower than the drop in the policy rate. Interest rates for loans granted through the Federal Reserve’s lending facility to small and medium-sized enterprises ranged from 4.8 percent to 6.5 percent and are guaranteed by the government. The European Central Bank cut the policy rate to zero and reduced the targeted longer-term refinancing operations rate by a total of 0.5 percentage points in March and April. The lowest rate may reach –1 percent. However, the interest rate for loans issued by commercial banks to small and micro businesses is 2.17 percent, down by 0.11 percentage points from end-2019. In general, when evaluating policy effectiveness, it is crucial to determine whether aggregate financing support for the real economy has been increased and whether financing costs have been reduced. In comparison, transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is much smoother in China, both in terms of guiding credit supply and reducing lending rates. Banks have fully played their principal role and the market mechanism runs fairly well. Going forward, emphasis will be placed on making the sound monetary policy more flexible and appropriate. Continuous efforts will be made to put forward targeted measures in line with the periodic features of pandemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production and to maintain the transmission efficiency of monetary policy. This will further alleviate the real difficulties facing the real economy and offset the impact of COVID-19. The weighted average interest rates on loans declined, and the corporate lending rates continued to move downwards. In March, the one-year LPR fell by 10 bps from last December to 4.05 percent and the over-five-year LPR fell by 5 bps to 4.75 percent. In March, the weighted average lending rate stood at 5.08 percent, down 0.36 percentage points from last December and 0.61 percentage points year on year. In particular, the weighted average interest rate on ordinary loans reached 5.48 percent, down 0.26 percentage points from last December and 0.56 percentage points year on year; the weighted average bill financing rate posted 2.94 percent, down 0.32 percentage points from last December and 0.70 percentage points year on year; theweighted average individual mortgage rate was 5.60 percent, down 0.02 percentage points from last December and 0.08 percentage points year on year. The corporate lending rate in March was reduced by 0.3 percentage points from end-2019, a drop clearly exceeding that of the LPR, which shows that the LPR reform has had remarkable effects. It has begun to act on strengthening the independent pricing capacities of financial institutions, improving the competitiveness of loan markets, and smoothing the market rate transmission. In mid-April, among ordinary loans, loans with rates lower than 90 percent of the benchmark accounted for 28.9 percent, 3 times that in July 2019 when the LPR reform had not yet kicked off. The implicit floor on loan rates was completely removed and pricing became increasingly market-based. In March, the share of ordinary loans with rates above, at, or below the LPR registered 72.83 percent, 2.75 percent, and 24.42 percent, respectively. In general, the LPR premium decreased compared with that in last December. Sharp interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve prompted a dip in interest rates on foreign-currency deposits and loans. In March, the weighted average interest rates on demand and large-value USD-denominated deposits with maturities within 3 months registered 0.21 percent and 1.43 percent respectively, down 0.09 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points from last December respectively. The weighted average interest rates of USD-denominated loans with maturities within 3 months and with maturities between 3 months (including 3 months) and 6 months registered 2.19 percent and 1.92 percent respectively, down 0.82 percentage points and 1.09 percentage points respectively from last December.Growth of deposits remained stable. At the end of March, outstanding deposits in domestic and foreign currencies in all financial institutions posted RMB206.4 trillion, up 9.2 percent year on year, 0.6 percentage points higher than that at the end of the previous year. Outstanding RMB deposits registered RMB201 trillion, up 9.3 percent year on year, 0.6 percentage points higher than that at the end of the previous year. Outstanding deposits in foreign currencies stood at USD765.4 billion, an increase of USD7.6 billion from the beginning of the year and a deceleration of USD33.7 billion year on year. Fiscal revenues tapered off, while expenditures on public health, such as pandemic containment, were higher. Fiscal deposits decreased by 10.7 percent year on year. III. Money supply and aggregate financing to the real economy increased reasonably At the end of March, outstanding M2 stood at RMB208.1 trillion, up 10.1 percent year on year, an acceleration of 1.4 percentage points from the end of 2019. Outstanding M1 stood at RMB57.5 trillion, a year-on-year growth of 5 percent and 0.6 percentage points higher than that at the end of the previous year. Outstanding M0 reached RMB8.3 trillion, up 10.8 percent year on year, an increase of 5.4 percentage points from the end of 2019. In Q1 2020, RMB583.3 billion of net cash was injected into the economy, a rise of RMB410 billion year on year. According to preliminary statistics, the outstanding aggregate financing to the real economy (AFRE) reached RMB262.24 trillion at the end of March, up 11.5 percent year on year and an acceleration of 0.8 percentage points over the end of the previous year. In Q1 2020, the incremental AFRE reached RMB11.08 trillion, an increase of RMB2.47 trillion year on year. Growth of the AFRE was characterized by the following features. First, RMB loans saw a substantially larger year-on-year increase. Second, the drop in entrusted loans narrowed, and undiscounted bankers’ acceptances registered larger month-on-month growth. Third, growth of both corporate bonds and equity financing accelerated. Fourth, government bonds saw a larger year-on-year increase. Fifth, the decline of asset-backed securities by depository financial institutions accelerated from the previous year, while the growth of loans that were written off decelerated. IV. The RMB exchange rate remained basically stable, and cross-border RMB transactions grew rapidly Since the beginning of 2020, cross-border capital flows and foreign exchange supply and demand have been basically in equilibrium, with market expectations generally stable. Based on market supply and demand, the RMB exchange rate moved in both directions and remained basically stable at a reasonable equilibrium level. With the world economy struck by the pandemic, volatility in the international foreign exchange market swelled dramatically. The RMB exchange rate also fluctuated somewhat, but it showed relatively strong resilience while remaining flexible. The RMB exchange rate against the USD depreciated marginally and the rate against a basket of currencies appreciated. At the end of March, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) RMB exchange-rate index and the RMB exchange rate index based on the special drawing rights (SDRs) basket closed at 94.06 and 91.35, up 2.92 percent and down 0.5 percent from end-2019, respectively. According to calculations by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), from end-2019 to the end of March, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the RMB appreciated by 2.46 percent and 3.13 percent, respectively. From 2005 when reform of the exchange rate formation regime commenced to end-March, the NEER and REER of the RMB appreciated by 35.56 percent and 51.04 percent, respectively. At the end of March, the central parity of the RMB against the USD was 7.0851, a depreciation of 1.54 percent from end-2019. From the launch of the reform of the exchange rate formation regime in 2005, the central parity of the RMB against the USD appreciated by 16.82 percent on a cumulative basis. In Q1 2020, the annualized volatility rate of the RMB exchange rate against the USD was 5.7 percent, which was greater than the average in 2019, but less than those of the major international currencies and the emerging market currencies in the midst of the global financial market turmoil. In Q1 2020, cross-border receipts and payments in RMB totaled RMB6.1 trillion, up 39 percent year on year. In particular, RMB receipts and payments registered RMB3 trillion and RMB3.1 trillion, respectively. RMB cross-border receipts and payments under the current account grew 15 percent over the previous year to RMB1.5 trillion. Specifically, settlement of trade in goods registered RMB1.1 trillion, whereas settlement of trade in services and other items registered a cumulative RMB0.4 trillion. RMB cross-border receipts and payments under the capital account posted RMB4.6 Part 2. Monetary Policy Operations In Q1 2020, amid the complicated situations such as the mounting downward economic pressures both in and out of China caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and the massive volatility in international financial market, the PBC adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, implemented the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, coordinated pandemic containment with economic and social development, implemented a sound monetary policy in a more flexible and appropriate manner, and adopted preemptive forceful measures. During different phases of battling COVID-19, the PBC innovated policy tools and rolled out measures as needed. By stabilizing expectations, expanding the aggregate amount, adopting targeted measures, emphasizing loan extensions, innovating measures, and focusing on implementation, the PBC effectively supported pandemic control and work and production resumption and cushioned the impact of the outbreak on the economy. All these efforts helped to foster a proper monetary and financial environment for winning the battle against the outbreak and for maintaining stability of employment, the financial sector, foreign trade, foreign and domestic investment, and expectations. I. Conducting open market operations in a flexible manner Effectively responding to the COVID-19 disruptions by acting decisively to inject short-term liquidity. In light of the possible large short-term disruptions to the financial market when it reopened after the Spring Festival, on February 2, the final day of the Spring Festival vacation, the PBC announced stronger-than-expected liquidity injection measures to stabilize market expectations. From February 3 to 4, RMB1.7 trillion of short-term repos were conducted through open market operations (OMOs), thus supporting the stable operation of the financial market. Maintaining adequate liquidity at a reasonable level with an appropriate amount and tempo of OMOs. As domestic market sentiments gradually stabilized, the PBC suspended OMOs in succession beginning in mid-February and properly withdrew liquidity when repos matured, guiding liquidity aggregates to return to a normal level. With the approach of end-March, due to a strong demand for funds at the end of the quarter, and somewhat unstable market sentiments caused by the continued liquidity strain of the US dollar in the overseas market, the PBC conducted 7-day repos at the end of the first quarter to shore up market confidence and to guarantee the smooth performance of all types of financial institutions entering the new quarter. The OMO rates moved downward. From the beginning of the year to end-April, the 7-day repo rate dropped 30 basis points to 2.2 percent, and the MLF rate dropped 30 basis points, signaling a strengthened countercyclical adjustment of monetary policy and guiding money market interest rates to move downward. Meanwhile, the financing cost for the real economy was reduced through LPR transmissions. In Q1 2020, money market rates moved steadily with less volatility, remaining within a reasonable range. In Q1 2020, the 7-day repo rate (DR007), which is a funding rate between depository institutions and pledged by government-backed bonds in the interbank market, averaged 2.11 percent, 39 basis points lower than that in Q4 2019. At end-Q1, the DR007 stood at 2.09 percent, 64 and 72 basis points lower than that in the same period of the previous year and end-2019, respectively. Conducting central bank bill swap (CBS) operations successively. In order to improve the market liquidity of perpetual bonds issued by banks and to support banks to replenish capital through perpetual bond issuances, the PBC conducted CBS operations three times in Q1, once in each month, totaling RMB16 billion. The maturities of all these operations were three months at a fixed rate of 0.1 percent. The bonds swapped with the PBC included not only perpetual bonds issued by large-sized commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banks but also those issued by urban commercial banks, reflecting support by the central bank to small and medium-sized banks to replenish capital through perpetual bond issuances. Issuing central bank bills in Hong Kong on a regular basis. On February 13 and March 26, the PBC issued three batches of RMB-denominated central bank bills in Hong Kong, totaling RMB40 billion. Specifically, the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year bills registered RMB20 billion, RMB10 billion, and RMB10 billion, respectively, with the balance standing at RMB80 billion as of end-March. The issuance enriched RMB assets with high credit ratings in the offshore market, fostered the sound development of the offshore RMB money market as well as the offshore issues of RMB bonds by other entities, and further promoted the use of RMB as an international currency. II. Conducting well-timed Standing Lending Facility and Medium-term Lending Facility operations Standing Lending Facility (SLF) operations were conducted to provide short-term liquidity in a timely manner. The demand of locally incorporated financial institutions was met in full amount, with the SLF playing the role of the ceiling of the interest rate corridor, thus promoting the smooth operation of the money market. In Q1 2020, the PBC conducted a total of RMB102.7 billion SLF operations, with the balance registering RMB30.6 billion at end-March. The overnight, 7-day, and 1-month SLF rates registered 3.35 percent, 3.50 percent, and 3.85 percent respectively at end-March, basically at the same level as those in the previous quarter. On April 10, the abovementioned SLF rates were lowered by 30 basis points, after which the overnight, 7-day, and 1-month SLF rates registered 3.05 percent, 3.2 percent, and 3.55 percent, respectively. The PBC conducted timely MLF operations to guarantee the supply of base money, with a declining rate. In Q1 2020, the PBC conducted a total of RMB600 billion of MLF operations, all with a maturity of one year. At end-March, the outstanding MLF registered RMB4290 billion, an increase of RMB600 billion from the beginning of the year. On February 17, the rate of the MLF declined by 10 basis points from the previous operation to 3.15 percent, and on April 15, the rate declined by 20 basis points to 2.95 percent, hence improving the risk appetite and boosting market confidence. The decline of the rate reflected the lower average marginal funding cost of financial institutions, which helps reduce the actual corporate lending rate through the LPR and to promote lower social funding costs. III. Enhancing monetary and credit support to offset the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak To offset the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, the PBC resolutely followed the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, acted promptly and proactively, and adopted a series of monetary and credit policies to boost domestic demand, to contribute to work and production resumption, and to stabilize employment. First, liquidity remained adequate at a reasonable level. A total amount of RMB1.7 trillion was injected into the market when it reopened after the Spring Festival vacation. In addition to the release of over RMB800 billion through the across-the-board RRR cut of 0.5 percentage points at the beginning of the year, a further RMB550 billion was released in March through the targeted RRR cuts, hence supporting loans of financial institutions in the inclusive finance area. Second, special central bank lending was launched to provide targeted support to key areas and to enterprises in battling COVID-19. In support of winning the fight against the outbreak, the PBC released the Notice on Providing Special Central Bank Lending to Support the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (Yinfa No.28 [2020]) on January 31, 2020. The aim was to provide low-cost special central bank lending in a total amount of RMB300 billion to major national banks and some locally incorporated banks in 10 key provinces (municipalities), such as Hubei, to support the provision of credit by financial institutions at favorable rates to key enterprises directly engaged in the production, transportation, and sale of key medical supplies and daily necessities in the fight against the virus. Third, an additional RMB500 billion of central bank lending and central bank discount quotas was introduced to support work and production resumption in anorderly manner. The PBC released the Notice of the People’s Bank of China on Ramping up Central Bank Lending and Central Bank Discounts to Support Orderly Work and Production Resumption (Yinfa No.53 [2020]) on February 26, 2020, increasing central bank lending and central bank discount quotas by RMB500 billion, and at the same time reducing the interest rate of central bank lending designated for agricultural sector and small businesses by 0.25 percentage points to 2.5 percent. Therefore, low-cost and inclusive funding support was provided for the orderly resumption of work and production, and debt repayment, capital turnover, the expansion of the funding scale, and other urgent issues confronting enterprises were also addressed. Fourth, another RMB1 trillion of central bank lending and central bank discounts quotas were introduced to support the economic recovery and development. The PBC released the Notice of the People’s Bank of China on Ramping Up Central Bank Lending and Central Bank Discounts for Small and Medium-sized Banks to Extend Credit Supply Designated for Agricultural Entities, MSBs, and Private Businesses (Yinfa No.93 [2020]) on April 20, 2020. The quotas of central bank lending and central bank discounts were raised by RMB1 trillion, thus enabling the issue of loans at favorable rates to MSMEs in a wider scale and with a wider coverage and supporting a larger credit supply to agriculture, foreign trade, and other sectors that were heavily affected by the outbreak. Fifth, synergy in the financial system was forged and counter-cyclical adjustments were strengthened. Financial institutions were guided to provide differentiated financial services to areas with different COVID-19 alert levels. Major state-owned banks were urged to ramp up support for MSBs in inclusive finance areas, special credit support from policy banks was put in place, and locally incorporated banks were guided to serve local communities effectively Five ministries, with active cooperation between the PBC and the CBIRC, released the Notice on Temporary Loan Deferments of Principal and Interest for Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (Yinbaojianfa No.6 [2020]) on March 1, 2020, encouraging financial institutions to allow temporary loan deferments in both principal and interest to qualified MSMEs with temporary liquidity difficulties on the basis of their applications. The repayment date may be extended to June 30.Box 2 The Precise Role of Central Bank Lending and Central Bank Discounts in Combating COVID-19 and Promoting Economic and Social Development In order to coordinate pandemic containment with economic and social development, the PBC has taken the initiative in introducing policy measures. Based on the progress of pandemic containment, the PBC has provided RMB300 billion worth of special central bank lending, RMB500 billion worth of central bank lending and central bank discounts, and RMB1 trillion worth of central bank lending and central bank discounts in succession, with a combined quota of RMB1.8 trillion. The role of central bank lending and central bank discounts in providing targeted liquidity has been brought into full play, vigorously supporting containment of the pandemic, the provision of medical supplies and daily necessities, resumption of work and production, and development of the real economy, especially the MSMEs. 1. The PBC has reasonably mastered the pace and strength of central bank lending and central bank discounts. In response to the pandemic containment and economic and social development, this round of central bank lending and central bank discounts has been employed sequentially with increased policy strength on three occasions since the beginning of this year. In order to win the battle against the pandemic and ensure the provision of medical supplies and daily necessities, on January 31 the PBC provided special central bank lending amounting to RMB300 billion, which was intended to provide low-cost funds to major national banks and selected locally incorporated banks in key provinces including Hubei. These banks were expected to provide credit support at preferential interest rates to major enterprises that participated in the production, transportation, and sales of medical supplies and daily necessities for pandemic containment. With the pandemic preliminarily under control at home, in order to support the orderly resumption of work and production, on February 26 the PBC raised the quota for central bank lending and central bank discounts by a total of RMB500 billion and cut the central bank lending rate on loans supporting the agricultural sector and small businesses by 0.25 percentage points to 2.5 percent. This expanded the coverage and inclusiveness of credit support and made low-cost inclusive funding accessible to more enterprises, thus solving their urgent difficulties in work and production resumption, repayment of debts, turnover of capital, and expansion of funding. In an attempt to shore up the real economy and mitigate the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak, on April 20 the PBC again increased the quota for central banking lending and central bank discounts by RMB1 trillion, which was to be used to issue preferential loans to the vast number of MSMEs. Financial institutions were encouraged to increase their credit supply to the agro-linked sector, foreign trade, as well as sectors severely hit by the pandemic. This policy has boosted credit support with more strength, wider coverage, and enhanced inclusiveness. 2. Characteristics of central bank lending and central bank discounts since the beginning of this year. The three-time implementation of central bank lending and central bank discounts was featured by broadened coverage, growing inclusiveness, preferential interest rates, and precise requirements on the use of funds. First, the policy coverage was broadened gradually with growing inclusiveness. The RMB300 billion worth of special central bank lending was provided to 9 national banks and 31 locally incorporated banks in 10 provinces (municipalities). List-based management was adopted for major enterprises, which were selected by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the provincial governments of key provinces. It was required that the funds be used for the production and business operations of industries related to pandemic containment. The RMB500 billion and RMB1 trillion worth of central bank lending was provided to over 4,000 locally incorporated financial institutions nationwide. To be specific, RMB500 billion was expected to be provided to more than 500,000 economic entities including enterprises, and RMB1 trillion was to support over 2 million economic entities. Second, preferential interest rates helped bring down the financing costs of the real economy. The interest rate on the RMB300 billion worth of special central bank lending was the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) of the previous month minus 250 basis points (bps), or 1.35 percent at the time. Financial institutions were required to issue loans with the funds from the special central bank lending at an interest rate no higher than the latest one-year LPR minus 100 bps, or 2.85 percent at the time. With a 50 percent discount subsidized by public financing, the actual financing cost of enterprises was ensured to be lower than 1.6 percent. The interest rate on the RMB500 billion worth of central bank lending stood at 2.5 percent, and financial institutions were required to use the funds from the central bank lending and central bank discounts to issue loans at an interest rate no higher than the latest LPR plus 50 bps, or 4.35 percent at the time. In terms of the central bank lending and central bank discounts in the amount of RMB1 trillion, small and medium-sized banks were guided to issue loans with the corresponding funds at a preferential interest rate at about 5.5 percent to the vast number of MSMEs, with the financing cost averaging below 5.5 percent. Third, a reimbursement-based management mode was adopted to guide the use of funds, i.e., issuing loans first and applying for funding later, so as to prevent the misuse of funds. Financial institutions were required to issue loans to enterprises that meet the requirements in the first place, and then to apply to the PBC for central bank lending in the same amount. Therefore, use of funds from central bank lending could be precisely managed. The PBC also required financial institutions to set up an electronic file to closely track and monitor the use of funds in a bid to prevent the misuse of funds. 3. Implementation of the policy has achieved results. The three-time implementation of central bank lending and central bank discounts played a positive role in supporting pandemic containment, resumption of work and production, and economic and social development. The provision of special central bank lending in the amount of RMB300 billion is coming to an end. As of May 5, 9 national banks and locally incorporated banks in 10 provinces (municipalities) had cumulatively issued RMB269.3 billion worth of preferential loans to a total of 7,037 key enterprises, with each enterprise granted preferential loans worth no more than RMB40 million. The weighted average interest rate on the preferential loans posted 2.50 percent, bringing down the actual financing costs of enterprises to approximately 1.25 percent after deducting the subsidy from the public financing, i.e., a 50-percent discount on the interest. At present, the scarcity of medical supplies has been substantially eased and the supply of daily necessities has returned to normal. Of the RMB500 billion worth of central bank lending and central bank discounts, 80 percent have been used to issue loans. As of May 5, preferential loans (including discounts) cumulatively issued by locally incorporated banks amounted to RMB399.6 billion, benefiting 524,000 enterprises (including rural households). To be specific, agro-linked loans, MSB loans for inclusive finance, and bank discounts posted RMB72.6 billion, RMB258.3 billion, and RMB68.7 billion, with the weighted average interest rates standing at 4.38 percent, 4.43 percent, and 3.05 percent respectively. All the above-mentioned interest rates were below the latest oneyear LPR plus 50 bps, thus meeting the regulatory requirements. The policy of the RMB1 trillion worth of central bank lending and central bank discounts has been put in place. The PBC branches and sub-branches have been carrying out the credit supply in an orderly manner. As a continuation of the previous two phases of policy implementation, the third provision of RMB1 trillion is expected to take effect, providing credit support for the real economy and guiding the downward trend of social financing costs. IV. Lowering the required reserve ratio for financial institutions The RRR and excess reserve ratio for financial institutions were cut to support development of the real economy. First, on January 6, 2020, the PBC lowered the RRR for financial institutions (excluding finance companies, financial leasing companies, and auto finance companies) by 0.5 percentage points, releasing over RMB800 billion of long-term funds. Second, on March 16, the PBC implemented a targeted RRR cut for inclusive finance. Based on the assessment on the issuance of loans for inclusive finance in 2019, it granted a preferential RRR cut of 0.5–1.5 percentage points to eligible institutions, and thereby released approximately RMB400 billion in net long-term funds. Moreover, joint-stock commercial banks that received a 0.5-percentage-point RRR cut according to this assessment will enjoy an additional RRR cut of 1 percentage point. The cut was expected to release long-term funds of about RMB150 billion, all of which are required to be used to issue inclusive finance loans. Third, the RRR cut of 1 percentage point for rural commercial banks, rural cooperative banks, village banks, and city commercial banks operating solely within provincial-level administrative regions was carried out in two phases, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points each time, on April 15 and May 15 respectively. About RMB400 billion of long-term funds were freed up by the cuts. Fourth, starting from April 7, the interest rate on excess reserve deposited in the central bank by financial institutions was cut from 0.72 percent to 0.35 percent. All the above-mentioned policies have contributed to boosting financial institutions’ support for MSMEs, bringing down social financing costs, and shoring up the real economy. V. Further improving the macroprudential policy framework The role of the macroprudential assessment (MPA) was effectively brought into play to optimize the credit structure and promote the financial supply-side structural reform. In Q1 2020, the central economic work conference required that medium and long-term funding be increased for the manufacturing sector and the difficulties faced by private enterprises and MSMEs be alleviated in terms of accessing affordable funding. In line with these requirements, the PBC further increased the weight of financing for MSBs, private enterprises, and the manufacturing sector in the MPA, in order to guide financial institutions to enhance credit support for related enterprises. A new assessment index, i.e., use of central bank lending, was introduced to encourage locally incorporated banks to better use the newly-added RMB500 billion worth of central bank lending and the central bank discounts quota in issuing preferential MSME loans. The use of funds released from the targeted RRR cuts by joint-stock banks was also incorporated into the MPA, requiring joint-stock banks to further increase credit supply for inclusive finance. The parameter for overall cross-border financing was adjusted in the MPA, bringing down financing costs for the real economy. In a bid to expand the use of foreign capital, facilitate cross-border financing for domestic institutions, and reduce financing costsfor the real economy, on March 11 the PBC and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), based on the current macroeconomic conditions and the balance of payments, released the Notice on Adjusting the Parameter for Overall Crossborder Financing in the MPA (Yinfa No. 64 [2020]), increasing the parameter from 1 to 1.25. After the policy adjustment, the upper limit on the risk-weighted balance of cross-border financing was raised accordingly. This policy is intended to help domestic institutions, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and private enterprises, make full use of resources and markets at home and abroad, broaden financing channels, alleviate their difficulties in accessing affordable funding, and promote the resumption of work and production, so as to better serve the development of the real economy. VI. Giving full play to the role of structural monetary policy instruments The PBC actively leveraged credit policy to support central bank lending, central bank discounts, pledged supplementary lending (PSL), and other policy tools, and to guide financial institutions to enhance support for key areas in the national economy and weak links, such as MSBs, private firms, agriculture, rural areas, and rural residents, as well as poverty alleviation. The Notice of the People’s Bank of China on Leveraging the Special Quota of Central Bank Lending in Support of Agriculture, Rural Areas, and Rural Residents to Facilitate the Expansion of Credit to the Hog Breeding Sector (Yinfa No.56 [2020]) was issued on February 28. The PBC provided RMB20 billion of the special central bank lending quota targeting agriculture, rural areas, and rural residents in an attempt to support credit expansion to the hog breeding sector. Central bank lending to support special poverty alleviation projects was leveraged in a bid to increase credit supply to areas of extreme poverty, including the “three autonomous regions,” i.e., Tibet, four prefectures in southern Xinjiang, and the Tibetan areas in four provinces, and the “three autonomous prefectures,” i.e., Linxia in Gansu, Liangshan in Sichuan, and Nujiang in Yunnan, and to cut down on the financing costs in these areas as well as to promote realization of the goals of targeted poverty alleviation and elimination. In Q1, RMB6.3 billion of central bank lending to support special poverty alleviation projects was issued, with the nationwide outstanding amount of such lending reaching RMB13.9 billion at the end of March. Outstanding central bank lending to support agriculture, rural areas, and rural residents stood at RMB278.4 billion at the end of March. Outstanding central bank lending for MSBs and for poverty alleviation posted RMB370.4 billion and RMB158.2 billion, respectively. Outstanding central bank discounts registered RMB508.2 billion. In Q1, the PBC provided RMB20.2 billion of PSLs to policy and development banks, with the outstanding volume registering RMB3.5576 trillion at the end of March The targeted medium-term lending facility (TMLF) was conducted. The TMLF provided a stable and long-term funding source for financial institutions to expand credit supply to private firms and MSBs at preferential interest rates. In January, the PBC conducted one-year TMLF operations at an interest rate of 3.15 percent, totaling RMB240.5 billion. At the end of March, the outstanding TMLF stood at RMB805.6 billion. VII. Leveraging the structural guidance role of credit policies The PBC fully implemented the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, upheld the supply-side structural reform as the main task, and guided financial institutions to enhance their support to key areas of the national economy and to weak links. By channeling funds to back the real economy, especially the MSMEs, and focusing on employment in key industries and key population, it aimed to be successful in the battle of poverty elimination and in the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. First, financial services were provided to effectively promote targeted poverty alleviation. Efforts were made to reinforce the application of and guidance on policy tools, to provide more financial resources to extremely poor areas, and to maintain rapid expansion in loans and central bank lending to areas of extreme poverty, including the three autonomous regions, i.e., Tibet, the four prefectures in southern Xinjiang, and the Tibetan areas in four provinces and the three autonomous prefectures, i.e., Linxia in Gansu, Liangshan in Sichuan, and Nujiang in Yunnan. Second, financial services were further strengthened to support rural revitalization. Measures were taken to financially safeguard spring farming, tillage preparation, and hog production, to support financial institutions’ expansion of the scope of collateral, to explore innovation in pledging livestock and poultry and in collateralizing collective assets and shares, in a bid to actively meet the financing needs of a new-type agricultural business entities. Third, financial services were actively provided to support resumption of the work and production of MSMEs. The PBC guided financial institutions to enhance their credit support for MSMEs by using funds from central bank lending and discounts so as to lower comprehensive financing costs. Enterprises with short-term difficulties due to COVID-19 are allowed to temporarily defer payments of principal and interest. Guidelines were given for no irrational recalling, discontinuing, or cutting of loans. Financial institutions were encouraged to increase the credit supply to MSBs with funds collected by issuing special financial bonds to support MSBs. A total of RMB131.5 billion of such bonds was issued in Q1. Fourth, continued efforts were made to enhance financial support for the high-quality development of manufacturing. Commercial banks were guided to provide personalized credit products and financial services based on the features of manufacturing enterprises and to strengthen their financing support for high-tech manufacturing. Fifth, financial support for employment and entrepreneurship was strengthened. With communication and cooperation enhanced among agencies, the PBC studied and improved policies for secured loans, eased criteria for loan applicants, improved loan approval efficiency, and stepped up financial support for the employment and entrepreneurship of special social groups, including veterans, college graduates, and migrant workers returning home for business start-ups. VIII. Deepening the market-oriented interest rate reform The PBC continued to put in place reform measures to lower the real interest rates on corporate loans. Since 2020, application of the LPR was further promoted. The one-year and above-five-year LPR were reported at 4.05 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively in March, and reduced to 3.85 percent and 4.65 percent in April, respectively, 30 basis points and 15 basis points lower than those in December 2019, respectively. Given its indication in direction and guidance, the LPR helps to further lower the real interest rates on loans. In line with market-oriented and law-based principles, the PBC promoted a shift in the pricing benchmark for outstanding floatingrate loans in an orderly manner, which started from March 1 as scheduled. After basic completion of the shift, the LPR is expected to have a more significant effect on transmitting the lowered LPR to loan interest rates, so that the difficulties and high costs of financing for MSBs will be further alleviated. Box 3 Significant Achievements in the Loan Prime Rate Reform In accordance with the decisions and arrangements of the State Council, on August 17, 2019, the PBC released an announcement on reforming and improving the formation mechanism for the LPR, with the aim of deepening the market-oriented reform of loan interest rates. After a period of continued efforts, significant achievements were made in the LPR reform. First, the market-based LPR better reflects changes in market demand and supply. After the introduction of the LPR in 2013, due to the banks’ inertia in pricing loans and other factors, the spread between the LPR and the benchmark loan interest rate remained relatively constant, with a low degree of market orientation. The LPR reform allowed panel banks to make quotes based on their own actual loan interest rates for prime clients by adding some basis points to the interest rate of the MLF. Determined by market bidding, the interest rate of the MLF reflects the average marginal funding cost of banks. The LPR is more market-based given its formation by adding some basis points to the MLF interest rate. With the gradual decline of the LPR since August 2019, the one-year LPR was reduced by a cumulative 0.4 percentage points, fully reflecting the changes in demand and supply of market funds. Second, the PBC promoted the application of the LPR in the order of “new loans first, outstanding loans second.” Banks’ application of the LPR to the price-setting of new loans was incorporated into the assessment of the MPA, thus propelling banks to use the LPR in setting loan prices in an orderly manner. New loans using the LPR in price-setting accounted for 90 percent of all such loans by the end of December 2019. From January 1, 2020, banks are not allowed to sign new contracts of floating-rate loans with reference to the benchmark loan interest rates. On this basis, replacement of the pricing benchmark for outstanding floating-rate loans was launched on March 1, 2020 as scheduled, and was orderly advanced in line with market-oriented and law-based principles. Affected by COVID-19, banks, in an attempt to allow clients to process replacements and to avoid the gathering of people, during the early stages handled the business via internet banks and mobile banks, among other online methods. As progress has been achieved in this respect, with the stabilization of COVID-19 containment and future acceleration in the resumption of work and production, replacement of the pricing benchmark for outstanding floating-rate loans will be stepped up. Third, efficiency of the transmission from monetary policy to loan interest rates was strengthened remarkably. During April 11–20, 2020, new loans with interest rates lower than 0.9 times the original benchmark loan interest rate accounted for 28.9 percent of all new loans, and this proportion more than tripled from its level in July 2019 when the reform has yet started. The implicit floor on loan rates was completely removed. The internal pricing mechanism of banks was further improved, and the market-determined LPR gradually replaced the loan benchmark interest rate as the main reference for internal funds transfer pricing (FTP) of commercial banks. According to statistics, most national banks have embedded the LPR in the FTP curve. Owing to the higher correlation between the FTP and the LPR, the FTP in commercial banks became more market-oriented. Fourth, significant achievements have been made with reform measures to facilitate a reduction of the real loan interest rate. After the LPR reform was launched, with strengthened awareness and capability of price negotiations with enterprises, the loan market became more competitive. Some banks actively provided services for grassroots clients and ramped up their loan support for MSBs, thus notably pushing downward the overall interest rates of corporate loans. In March 2020, the interest rate of general loans (personal mortgage loans excluded) stood at 5.48 percent, 0.62 percentage points lower than that in July 2019 when the reform has yet kicked off and 0.26 percentage points lower than that at the beginning of this year, a remarkably sharper decrease than the fall of the LPR over the same period. Fifth, the LPR reform played an important role in promoting the market-oriented reform of deposit interest rates. As the LPR reform deepened, loan interest rates were aligned with market interest rates and became more market-based. Due to the overall decrease in interest rates in the loan market, bank income from loans declined. To match the income from assets, banks cut the costs of the liabilities as needed, with lower incentives to attract deposits at high interest rates, thus guiding the decline of deposit rates. In fact, changes have taken place in the deposit rates as some banks have actively lowered the rates and rates on market-priced money market funds as well as other quasideposit products trended downwards. Hence, the deposit rates and market interest rates became increasingly aligned, i.e., shifting away from the existing two-track interest rate system into a unified system. The reform of interest rates in the loan market enabled the deposit rates to effectively become more market-oriented. Going forward, the PBC will continue to deepen the LPR reform and release its potentials. Further efforts will be made to smooth the transmission channel from market interest rates to loan interest rates, facilitate the reduction of real loan interest rates, and support work and production resumption and economic and social development. Meanwhile, the PBC will promote the shift in the pricing benchmark for outstanding floating-rate loans in an orderly manner, strengthen its monitoring of the progress of the shift, and integrate the shift of outstanding corporate loans in financial institutions into the MPA and the eligibility prudential assessments, which is expected to be basically completed by the end of August. IX. Improving the market-oriented RMB exchange rate regime The PBC continued to advance the market-oriented exchange rate reform and to improve the managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. It maintained the flexibility of the exchange rate and gave play to the role of the exchange rate as an automatic stabilizer in adjusting the macro economy and the balance of payments. In the meantime, the PBC attached importance to guiding expectations and keeping the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. In Q1 2020, the highest and lowest CNY central parities were 6.8606 and 7.1052 against the USD, respectively. During the 58 trading days, the RMB appreciated on 27 days and depreciated on 31 days. The biggest intraday appreciation and depreciation were 0.45 percent (309 bps) and 0.76 percent (530 bps), respectively. The RMB exchange rate against other major international currencies floated two-ways with both appreciations and depreciations. At end-March, the central parities of the RMB against the dollar and the Japanese yen had depreciated 1.54 percent and 2.22 percent respectively from end-2019, while the RMB had appreciated 0.09 percent and 4.46 percent respectively against the euro and the pound. From the RMB exchange rate regime reform in 2005 to end-March 2020, the RMB against the dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen appreciated by a cumulative total of 16.82 percent, 28.24 percent, and 11.47 percent respectively. Direct RMB trading was buoyant on the interbank foreign exchange market with steady liquidity, which helped lower the exchange costs for market participants and facilitate bilateral trade and investment. X. Promoting resolution of financial risks in a prudent and orderly manner and deepening the reforms of financial institutions Risk resolution of Baoshang Bank (BSB) was promoted in a prudent and orderly manner. Since the takeover of BSB due to its severe credit risk, steady progress has been made by the joint efforts of all relevant parties. On April 30, BSB issued an announcement that part of its businesses, assets, and liabilities would be transferred to Mengshang Bank (MSB) and Huishang Bank. MSB was scheduled to open for business on May 6. On balance, this swift and decisive action has avoided further deterioration of the bank’s risks, ensured maximum protection of the legitimate rights and interests of its depositors and clients, and maintained overall social stability. Meanwhile, in line with the laws and regulations, it has put an end to the practice of de facto guaranteed repayments. During this entire process, the PBC has fully played its role as “lender of last resort”, which has effectively contained the risks of contagion from BSB to other small and medium-sized banks and thus has succeeded in defending the bottom line of no systemic risks. Phased achievements were made in disposing of high-risk small and medium-sized financial institutions. The PBC actively defused hidden risks in some city commercial banks, rural commercial banks, and rural credit cooperatives over the years, and ensured maximum protection of the legitimate rights and interests of creditors. It promoted provincial-level governments to formulate risk disposal plans for small and mediumsized financial institutions, according to the principle of “one province, one policy.” The reform and restructuring plan of Hengfeng Bank was successfully put in place and phased progress was made in the reform and restructuring of Bank of Jinzhou. Steady progress was made in the reform of development and policy financial institutions. Implementation of the reform plans for development and policy financial institutions was comprehensively promoted. The PBC, together with members of the Reform Working Group, promoted implementation of the reform measures in an orderly manner, such as establishing and enhancing the boards of directors, improving the governance structure, and redefining the scope of business. Currently, boards of directors of development and policy financial institutions have been established and are functioning effectively. The PBC will continue to guide policy financial institutions to stick to their responsibilities and business scope and to strengthen support for key areas and weak links, while strengthening risk prevention and control so as to better serve national development strategies. XI. Deepening the reforms of foreign exchange administration Foreign-exchange administration for trade in goods was further optimized. First, business processes of foreign exchange receipts and payments for imports of supplies necessary for battling COVID-19 were simplified. From January 27 to March 31, a total of 4,551 foreign exchange receipts and payments under trade in goods were expedited across the country through the green channel, totaling USD1.03 billion. Second, the pilot program of facilitating foreign exchange receipts and payments under trade in goods was expanded. By end-Q1 2020, the pilot programs of facilitating foreign exchange receipts and payments under trade in goods and in services were carried out in eight and two provinces (municipalities) across the nation, respectively. There were 41 pilot banks and 206 enterprises. A total of 73,000 foreign exchange receipts and payments were processed under trade in goods and services, worth a total USD57.2 billion. Third, enterprises across the nation succeeded in reporting online 852,000 foreign exchange transactions under trade in goods. Fourth, requirements on foreign exchange receipts and payments under trade in goods were simplified for small and micro businesses engaged in cross-border e-commerce. Meanwhile, these enterprises were exempt from directory registration. Fifth, electronic filing of taxation was continuously promoted in the area of foreign exchange payments for trade in services. At end-Q1 2020, 32,000 electronic taxation forms were filed, involving foreign exchange payments worth USD55.7 billion and bringing benefits to 12,600 enterprises. Cross-border financing and investment were further facilitated. First, requirements on presenting in advance authenticity-verifying documents were temporarily eased for settlements and payments of foreign exchange receipts under the capital account with respect to disease containment. From January 27 to March 27, a total of 4,895 facilitated payments of foreign exchange receipts under the capital account were processed across the nation, worth about USD900 million. Second, cross-border financing related to pandemic containment was facilitated and achieved. The external debt quota may be lifted for those enterprises which have genuine demand, and they can apply online for external debt registration. From January 27 to March 27, 742 cases of external debt registration were processed online, amounting to USD37 billion. Third, the pilot program of external debt facilitation was expanded and high-tech companies were supported to raise funds overseas. The scope of the pilot was expanded from Beijing Zhongguancun National Self-dependent Innovation Demonstration Zone to places such as Shanghai, Hubei, Guangdong, and Shenzhen, and eligible high-tech companies have been allowed to borrow funds voluntarily within a certain quota. Stability in the foreign exchange market was maintained. Priority was given to conducting monitoring and analysis of potential risks of cross-border capital flows incurred by COVID-19. Emphasis was placed on clue screening of illegal financial activities, such as underground banks, cross-border gambling, and illegal online foreign exchange trading. Forward-looking research was actively promoted on a cross-border anti-money-laundering mechanism, macro and micro regulation on banks, and on the foreign exchange wholesale market. In Q1, a total of 176 cases violating the laws and regulations of foreign exchange administration were handled, with the total fines amounting to RMB140 million. Part 3. Financial Market Conditions In Q1 2020, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial market experienced increased volatility. Capital prices in the money market dropped significantly with an overall easing of the supply of liquidity. The total volume of bond issuances saw yearon-year growth, with a rapid fall in bond yields. The stock market generally went up prior declining, with the major indexes sliding. I.

Institutional arrangements in the bond market In February 2020, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the PBC, and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) jointly issued a notice enabling eligible pilot commercial banks and insurance institutions capable of investment management, based on the principle of compliance, controllable risk, and sustainable business, to participate in the trade of treasury bond futures on China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX). In this way, the structure of treasury bond futures investors will be enriched and the stable and orderly development of the market will be promoted. The first batch of pilot institutions included Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of Communications (BOCOM). 2. Improving institutional arrangements in the capital market and the securities and futures industry The capability of the capital market to serve the real economy was further enhanced. First, in February the CSRC released three refinancing arrangements for listed companies, including the Decision on Revising the “Measures for the Administration of Securities Issuances by Listed Companies”. The arrangements relaxed the refinancing limitation of companies listed on the ChiNext Market. Second, in March, the CSRC released the Special Provisions on Shareholding Reductions by Venture Capital Fund Shareholders of Listed Companies after revision, which tapped into the potential of venture capital funds to support the entrepreneurship and innovation of enterprises. Third, in March, the CSRC released the Guidelines for the Evaluation of Science and Technology Innovation Attributes (for Trial Implementation), which made it more operable for the Exchange to evaluate the science and technology innovation attributes of companies listed on the STAR market. Regulation of securities institutions was further improved. For one thing, in January the SCRC released the Provisions on the Calculation Basis for Risk Control Indicators of Securities Companies, which further improved the system of risk control indicators of securities companies. For another, in March the CSRC decided to lower the payment ratio of securities companies in securities investor protection funds in 2019 and 2020, so as to lower their operating costs and strengthen support for the real economy. 3. Improving institutional arrangements in the insurance market Development of commercial insurance in the field of social services was bolstered. On January 23, the CBIRC, together with 12 other ministries and commissions, issued the Opinion on Promoting the Development of Commercial Insurance in the Field of Social Services, which introduced 11 policies and measures in five respects to help commercial insurance play a better role in the field of social services. The business of insurance asset management products was regulated in an all-round way. On March 18, the CBIRC released the Interim Measures for the Regulation of Insurance Asset Management Products, which specified the positioning, form, and issuance mechanism of asset management products, made clear the due responsibilities of the issuers, and implemented active supervision. Reform of accident insurance was accelerated. On January 17, the CBIRC released the Opinions on Accelerating the Reform of Accident Insurance, in order to rectify price distortions in accident insurance. 4. Further opening up the bond market In March 2020, under the guidance of the PBC, relevant financial infrastructures improved their transaction settlement arrangements and launched services such as rolling settlement and flexible settlement cycles, which met the diversified needs of foreign institutional investors and further facilitated their operations. 5. Enhancing coordinated supervision of the financial infrastructure After being deliberated and passed at the tenth meeting of the Central Committee for Deepening Overall Reform, the Work Plan on Coordinating Supervision over Financial Infrastructures was co-issued by the PBC, NDRC, MOF, CBIRC, CSRC, and SAFE. The work plan aims to further improve the coordinated supervision and construction planning of the financial infrastructure and to enhance capability to serve the real economy and to forestall financial risks. Part 4. Macroeconomic Overview I. Global economic and financial developments 1. The global economy is set to enter a recession As the global pandemic outbreak continues, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised downward its global growth forecast several times since 2020, according to which the per capita income in over 170 countries out of its 189 members will see negative growth. Risks are tilted to the downside in the advanced economies. During the seven weeks ending May 2, more than 33 million Americans filed first-time unemployment claims, and the jobless rate surged to 14.7 percent in April. Since the pandemic broke out in countries such as Italy, France, and Germany in February 2020, the extent of the economic slowdown in the euro area has sparked concerns. Growth in Japan was already on the verge of recession prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, and the pandemic will precipitate an economic downturn. The emerging market economies could see a fall in growth across the board. Due to the economic fallout of COVID-19, growth in the emerging market economies will probably continue to drop. The IMF projected that the emerging market economies as a whole would grow –1.0 percent in 2020, 4.7 percentage points slower than the growth of 3.7 percent in 2019. 2. The major central banks began a fresh round of monetary easing Central banks around the globe cut rates aggressively. Central banks in the advanced economies, such as the US Fed and the Bank of England (BOE), reduced rates substantially to address the financial turbulence caused by COVID-19 and to boost market confidence. In March, the US Fed and the BOE each joined the ranks of zero interest rates as they lowered rates twice by a total of 150 basis points (bps) and 65 bps, respectively. Central banks in the advanced economies either resumed or scaled up quantitative easing (QE). In Q1, the US Fed expanded its balance sheet considerably as it announced it would buy assets as necessary. The European Central Bank (ECB) first increased QE by EUR120 billion, and then announced that it would buy an additional EUR750 billion in assets by year-end. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) increased the size of asset purchased by nearly JPY8 trillion, and the BOE increased the size of assets purchased by GBP200 billion to GBP645 billion. Major central banks strengthened liquidity support by adopting a number of targeted facilities. The Fed introduced several emergency liquidity facilities, including the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility. The ECB launched additional longer-term refinancing operations, the BOE created the COVID Corporate Financing Facility to support liquidity among larger firms and the Term Funding Scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the BOJ put in place Special Funds-Supplying Operations for distressed businesses. 3. Issues and trends that merit attention First, supply and demand shocks resulting from the fast spread of COVID-19 have put the global economy on a recession trajectory for the short term. From the supply side, the pandemic has spread to most key parts of the global value chain, with production coming to a grinding halt and industrial chains disrupted. From the demand side, the pandemic has directly led to diminishing income for households and businesses, while fears and uncertainties over the pandemic have further dented market confidence, resulting in weaker consumption and investment. Second, the global economy is fraught with uncertainties as how the pandemic will develop remains unclear and as the intensity of policy responses varies from country to country. Although countries around the world have adopted a slew of measures to address the fallout from COVID-19, their policy intensity and effectiveness are different. A second wave of infection may come given the absence of strong international coordination, which may cause the economies to alternate between pausing and reopening. Third, pockets of financial risks accumulated at a faster pace, which warrants attention. The real economy has suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic. The credit risk and market risk have been growing in the corporate sector and financing institutions. If some countries respond late or inappropriately, financial risks may coincide with real economic risks. Fourth, the major economies have less room for policy maneuver. The major central banks have already cut policy rates to near zero, while much earlier the ECB and the BOJ had already introduced a negative interest rate policy. II. Macroeconomic developments in China In Q1 2020, COVID-19 dealt an unprecedented blow to China’s economic and social development. Despite the pandemic, China’s economy showed great resilience, the sound momentum of pandemic containment further consolidated, and work and production resumption was gradually approaching or had already reached a normal level. The production of livelihood-related fundamental industries and major products grew steadily, people’s basic livelihood was well-guaranteed, and overall economic and social development was stable. According to preliminary statistics, the GDP in Q1 2020 dropped by 6.8 percent year on year, while the CPI rose by 4.9 percent year on year. Box 4 Analysis of the Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the World and on China and the Policy Responses Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 has spread across the world with confirmed cases in over 200 countries and regions. As of May 5, the aggregate number of confirmed cases exceeded 3.7 million and the number of deaths exceeded 250,000. Given the impact of the pandemic, the IMF revised its forecast for 2020 global GDP growth down by 6.3 percentage points, from 3.3 percent in January to –3 percent, which would mark the worst economic recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The World Bank also predicted that GDP growth in the East Asia-Pacific region would slow down from 5.8 percent in 2019 to 2.1 percent in 2020. The pandemic has had a great impact on the global economy. First of all, countries have adopted lockdowns, business closures, and isolation measures, putting a halt to economic activities other than the production of essential goods and bringing the economies to a standstill. Second, international trade has shrunk significantly, reducing potential growth of the global economy. The World Trade Organization (WTO) predicted that global trade would shrink by 13 percent to 32 percent this year due to the pandemic and might be worse than that during the 2008 global financial crisis. Meanwhile, the global economic slowdown induced by the pandemic will further undermine external demand and exert large pressures on the trade sector. Third, most industries have gone into a temporary halt, taking a toll on the key links in the global supply chain. In recent decades, integrated global production has become a major source of world economic growth. As a result, the stagnation of economic activities in one country can easily weaken or even disrupt the global supply chain. Fourth, the pandemic has also changed the expectations of global investors, and black swan events in the international financial market have occurred frequently. In March, the US stock market plunged, triggering the circuit breaker four times. On April 20, international crude oil futures settled at a negative price for the first time in history. Financial risks have coincided with sluggishness in the real economy. The pandemic has also hit China’s economic and social development in an unprecedented manner. First, the production and operation of enterprises have been impacted. The extension of the Spring Festival holiday and the delay in resumption of work have reduced the effective working days. The traffic restrictions in some provinces and cities have also interrupted the flow of personnel and materials necessary for production. The relevant losses have been reflected in GDP growth in Q1 2020. Second, the demand-side indicators have decelerated year on year. Since the beginning of this year, consumer spending on retail, catering, and tourism has declined significantly. The pandemic has also profoundly influenced the behavior of economic entities. In particular, consumers may reduce consumption in shopping malls, theaters, and other crowded places for a long time. Third, external risks will continue to impact the domestic economy. It is difficult to improve the dampened international trade in the short term, and external demand may continue to decline, which will drag down China's economic growth further. Nonetheless, China’s overall economic fundamentals of stable growth, good long-term momentum, and high-quality development remain intact. According to the decisions and arrangement of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council, all sectors and regions have taken multipronged measures to comprehensively promote the resumption of work and production amid routine pandemic containment and to restore normal economic and social order. By the end of Q1 2020, China's industrial enterprises above a designated size had come close to full-scale resumption, restaurants, hotels and other enterprises in many regions had resumed business, and transportation and logistics were gradually returning to normal. Economic data have improved since March. However, the following risks merit attention. First, the duration and negative impact of the pandemic might exceed expectations. The pandemic is still serious in advanced countries like Europe and the US, and the effect of efforts to restart the economy remains to be seen. The number of newly confirmed cases is rising rapidly in some developing economies and agricultural product–exporting countries, and the future development of the pandemic is highly uncertain. Second, close attention should be paid to the spillovers of the highly accommodative unconventional monetary and fiscal policies in the major economies. Monetary and fiscal policies can only counteract the negative impact of the pandemic. The future global economic recovery and financial development still depend on progress in pandemic containment. Meanwhile, the negative effects of unconventional policies will play out gradually. Third, the domestic economy still faces many challenges. Enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have been hit hard by the pandemic. There is increasing pressure on employment and social security. More coordination is needed to resume work and production along the industrial chain. Continuous efforts should be made to guarantee supply of the main agricultural byproducts and to stabilize their prices. Fourth, there are also uncertainties in China's balance of payments and cross-border capital flows. On the one hand, given that the major central banks have significantly loosened monetary policy and China has taken the lead in pandemic containment as well as production resumption, RMB assets, which provide higher returns and relative security, may attract capital inflows. On the other hand, the continuous weakening of external demand and the decline in investor risk appetite may also reduce exports and cause capital outflows. Going forward, the sound monetary policy should be more flexible and appropriate whereby the PBC will keep a good grasp in the intensity, pace, and focus of the new polices, skillfully handle the relationship between stabilizing growth, protecting employment, restructuring the economy, preventing risks, and controlling inflation, ensure that the growth of M2 and aggregate financing to the real economy (AFRE) is basically in line with and slightly higher than nominal GDP growth, and support highquality economic development with appropriate money growth. The PBC will continue to maintain the two-way floating flexibility of the RMB exchange rate and stabilize expectations through multiple channels. In addition, the PBC will strengthen international policy coordination and effectively contain the impact of the pandemic. Furthermore, the PBC will adhere to bottom-line thinking, remain vigilant against potential external risks, prepare policies proactively, and promote stability in the national economy. 1.

Consumer prices witnessed a structural rise, and producer prices declined amidst stability Consumer prices went up structurally, with growth witnessing a month-on-month decline. In Q1 2020, the CPI rose by 4.9 percent year on year, an acceleration of 0.7 percentage points from the previous quarter, with growth of the CPI in January, February, and March registering 5.4 percent, 5.2 percent, and 4.3 percent, respectively. Specifically, the price of pork rose rapidly, which drove up food prices to a high level. Food prices grew by 20.3 percent year on year, an acceleration of 3 percentage points from the previous year. Non-food prices edged up steadily by 1.1 percent year on year, which was on par with the previous quarter. The growth of consumer goods prices accelerated, while growth of services decelerated.

Among this, the short-term external debt balance was USD1.2053 trillion, accounting for 59 percent of the total external debt balance. 6. Analysis by sector 6.1 The real estate sector In Q1 2020, nationwide housing prices were generally stable. Due to the impact of COVID-19, housing sales and investments in real estate development declined, but picked up gradually from March. Growth of real estate loans continued to moderate. At end-March, among the 70 medium and large-sized cities nationwide, newly built and second-hand residential housing prices increased by 5.4 percent and 2.7 percent year on year, 1.4 percentage points and 1 percentage point less, respectively, than the growth rates at end-2019.

With the living standards improving and the people’s health awareness growing, the pharmaceutical sector in China maintained a momentum of rapid development. First, economies of scale grew rapidly. Value added of pharmaceutical enterprises above a designated size witnessed year-on-year growth of 6.6 percent, 0.9 percentage points higher than that of the industrial sector. Second, investments in fixed assets saw fast growth. In 2019, investments in fixed assets of the pharmaceutical sector increased by 8.4 percent over the previous year, 5.3 percentage points faster than that of the manufacturing sector as a whole. Third, prices in the pharmaceutical sector rose steadily. The PPI of the pharmaceutical sector climbed up by 1.7 percent year on year, whereas the overall PPI dipped by 0.3 percent year on year. The pharmaceutical sector in China still faces mounting challenges to maintain sound development. First, technological research and innovation need to be improved, as pharmaceutical enterprises are still weak in fundamental research and in translating research results into applications. Second, upgrading the quality of pharmaceutical products remains a pending task. Competition in the pharmaceutical sector is fierce, coupled with serious product homogeneity and overcapacity of some products in the sector. In 2019, the capacity utilization rate of the pharmaceutical sector was 76.6 percent, down 1 percentage point from 2018. Third, the industrial concentration of the entire pharmaceutical sector remains low. At end-2019, the number of pharmaceutical enterprises above a designated size totaled 7,382. The sector, boasting a vast number of enterprises, is still struggling with a lack of scale and a low concentration of enterprises. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have placed great importance on the development and application of diagnostic reagents and medicines as well as on the provision of medical supplies. As a result, the sector realized an expansion of capacity and an increase in output within a short period of time, effectively meeting the needs of pandemic containment. Going forward, efforts should be made to advance research and development of safe and effective vaccines in a timely manner on the basis of adhering to science and ensuring safety. Meanwhile, efforts should also be made to enhance investments in pharmaceutical enterprises, accelerate the upgrading of product quality, promote industry-wide resource integration, and improve the long-run competitiveness of the pharmaceutical sector. Financial support will be enhanced in a bid to bolster the rapid and high-quality development of the pharmaceutical sector. Part 5. Monetary Policy Outlook I. Outlook for the Chinese economy The first quarter of 2020 witnessed an unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on economic and social development in China. However, the impact is, on the whole, controllable, so the great temporary challenges will not change the fundamentals of steady growth, long-term sound development, and high-quality development of the Chinese economy. Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the Chinese economy has demonstrated great resilience. With pandemic containment measures remaining in place, economic and social activities have gradually returned to normal, and work and production have resumed, approaching or reaching normal levels. The fight against the pandemic has spawned and promoted rapid development of many new industries and business models. The proactive fiscal policy has been more intensified and the sound monetary policy more flexible and appropriate, with higher priority given to supporting recovery of the real economy. Money and credit as well as aggregate financing to the real economy (AFRE) have been growing at a rate consistent with economic development, and the liquidity has been maintained adequate at a reasonable level. With proactive and effective structural monetary policies, financial support for the real economy, especially for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and private enterprises, has been continuously intensified. With prudent and decisive measures taken to prevent and control financial risks, the financial system has been generally healthy and capable of defusing various risks. The RMB exchange rate has remained basically stable and exhibited more flexibility in two-way fluctuations, thereby effectively preventing shocks of external financial risks. The risk of a global recession is intensifying, while the domestic economy is confronted with increasing challenges. Destabilizing factors and uncertainties have increased significantly as the global pandemic continues to spread. According to projections by the IMF, the global economy will experience a growth of –3 percent in 2020, a deceleration of 5.9 percentage points compared to 2019. With frequent breakouts of black swan events in international financial markets, the major countries have collectively adopted zero-rate monetary policies, and the balance sheets of the central banks have seen a sharp expansion. The pressures arising from imported pandemic case prevention and from international economic risks have been building up in China, and the resumption of work and production as well as economic and social development are facing new difficulties, in that structural, institutional, and cyclical concerns are intertwined and thereby pose unprecedented challenges for economic development. The current conditions necessitate work to fully assess the difficulties, risks, and uncertainties, enhance the sense of urgency, and ensure solid implementation of tasks regarding economic and social development. In response to problems caused by COVID-19, such as lack of demand, decline in consumption, difficulties in business operations, and building pressures on employment, cyclical adjustments will be intensified, strategies to increase domestic demand will be firmly implemented, and work concerning pandemic containment as well as economic and social development will be carried forward in a coordinated way. Inflation is generally under control and expectations are basically stable, with future developments to be watched closely. In the first two months of Q1 2020, the CPI temporarily soared above 5 percent, which was mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices, such as the price of pork, around the Spring Festival and the shrinking supply because of the pandemic. With the orderly resumption of work and production under way, and multiple measures taken by government departments to guarantee supply and stabilize prices, the CPI has shown a decelerating trend as it dropped to 4.3 percent in March, and inflation expectations are generally stable. Due to weak domestic demand and plunging commodity prices, the PPI retreated below zero with a deeper drop after temporarily turning positive in January. Factors such as COVID-19 may cause price disturbances in the short term through both supply and demand, which warrant continued monitoring and analysis. However, judging by the fundamentals, China’s economic performance is generally stable, and aggregate supply and demand are basically in equilibrium, providing no grounds for persistent inflation or deflation. II. Outlook for monetary policy in the next stage Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the PBC will resolutely implement the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, remain committed to achieving the target of completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and coordinate pandemic containment with economic and social development. With pandemic response measures kept in place, it will adhere to the guiding principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, and uphold the new development philosophy. Efforts will be intensified to ensure stability in six key areas, namely, employment, the financial sector, foreign trade, foreign investment, domestic investment, and market expectations, and to safeguard employment, people's basic livelihood, market entities, food and energy security, stability of industrial and supply chains, and the smooth functioning of grassroots administration, with the aim of achieving a decisive victory in the tough battle against poverty and completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. The PBC will pursue a sound monetary policy that is more flexible and appropriate, while the intensity, focus, and pace of policy conduct will be properly managed to accommodate changes in the pandemic containment situation and economic development at different stages. As countercyclical adjustments will be stressed in monetary policy, the PBC will attach higher priority to supporting the recovery of the real economy by adopting aggregate and structural policies to keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level and to help the real economy, particularly MSMEs, pull through the difficulties. The role of central bank lending and central bank discount policies as a propelling force will be brought into full play to provide financial services precisely for pandemic containment, the resumption of work and production, and development of the real economy. The relationship among stabilizing growth, safeguarding employment, adjusting structures, preventing risks, and controlling inflation will be properly handled, while work will be done to keep prices basically stable and to guide expectations in various ways. Moreover, the PBC will support banks replenishing capital through multiple channels so as to enhance their capacity to serve the real economy and to forestall and defuse financial risks. It will further the loan prime rate (LPR) reform and move ahead with the shift in the pricing benchmark for outstanding floating-rate loans in an orderly manner so as to smooth the mechanism of monetary policy transmission and guide market lending rates to move downward. The PBC will coordinate RMB and foreign exchange policies, and properly balance the domestic and external economic dynamics. It will deepen financial supply-side structural reforms, improve the modern financial system to make it highly adaptable, competitive, and inclusive, and foster a virtuous cycle in the national economy. First, the PBC will pursue a sound monetary policy that is more flexible and appropriate, enhance countercyclical adjustments, and keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level. It will closely monitor liquidity supply and demand as well as domestic and international markets, and employ a mix of monetary policy tools to keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level so that the growth of M2 and AFRE are basically in line with and slightly higher than nominal GDP growth. Macro management will be more forward-looking, precise, proactive, and effective, while the intensity and pace of liquidity injections will be better managed to ensure that money market rates perform stably within a reasonable range. The PBC will try to reach a dynamic balance among multiple targets, attach more importance to some targets such as economic growth and employment, and counter the impact of the pandemic with more forceful policies, thereby creating a favorable monetary and financial environment for effective containment of the pandemic and for supporting the recovery of the real economy. It will properly balance an internal equilibrium with an external equilibrium, and maintain China’s status as one of the few major economies in the world that is pursuing a normal monetary policy. Work will be done to improve the capital replenishment mechanism to make it sustainable, encourage banks to replenish capital through multiple channels such as the issuance of perpetual bonds, and prioritize support for capital replenishment of small and medium-sized banks so as to enhance their capacity to serve the real economy and to forestall and defuse financial risks. Second, the PBC will give full play to the role of central bank lending and central bank discount policies as a propelling force and provide financial services precisely for pandemic containment, the resumption of work and production, and the development of the real economy. It will continue giving play to the RMB300 billion of special central bank lending to fight the pandemic and guarantee supply until the quota is used up. Financial institutions will be guided to continue using the RMB 500 billion of central bank lending and central bank discount quotas to support the orderly resumption of work and production. Moreover, central bank lending and central bank discount policies with a total quota of RMB1 trillion will be properly implemented in line with the ongoing recovery of the real economy and will link up seamlessly with the preceding RMB300 billion and RMB500 billion. The PBC will further step up credit support for agro-linked enterprises, micro and small businesses (MSBs), private enterprises, foreign trade enterprises, and industries severely affected by the pandemic and will guide the reduction of social financing costs. Third, the PBC will explore the role of monetary and credit policies in promoting economic structural adjustments so as to better serve the real economy. It will further improve the required reserve ratio (RRR) policy framework featuring “three tranches and two preferential treatments”, and establish and improve a long-term mechanism of increasing bank loans to MSBs. Policy coordination will be enhanced so that financial resources will be channeled to fields that will benefit both the demand and supply sides and produce a multiplier effect, such as advanced manufacturing, livelihood improvements, and weak links in infrastructure development, thereby promoting industrial and consumption upgrading. Research will be conducted on the linkup between financial support for poverty eradication and rural revitalization policies, while work will be accelerated to roll out measures for the assessment of commercial banks’ services for rural revitalization. The PBC will guide financial institutions to improve incentives in internal assessments, enhance implementation of the mechanism under which people who have fulfilled their duties will not be held liable for losses, and strengthen cooperation with government-backed guarantee agencies in an effort to facilitate the allocation of more credit resources to MSBs and private enterprises. Work will be done to promote the development of supply chain finance and ramp up financial support for MSMEs based on the creditworthiness of core enterprises. The expiration date for the policy of delayed repayment of principal and interest will be duly extended for enterprises, particularly MSMEs, whose employment remains basically stable. Adhering to the principle that housing is for living in, not for speculation, and the requirement that the real estate market shall not be used to provide a short-term stimulus to the economy, the PBC will maintain the continuity, consistency, and stability of real estate finance policies. Fourth, the PBC will make more efforts to deepen the market-based interest rate reform and the reform of the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism so as to enhance the efficiency of financial resource allocations. The LPR reform will move steadily deeper. In line with market-oriented and law-based principles, the PBC will move ahead with the shift in the pricing benchmark for outstanding floating-rate loans in an orderly manner so as to smooth the mechanism of monetary policy transmission and to further bring down social financing costs by means of reform. It will make effective use of the self-regulatory mechanism for market rate pricing, regulate deposit rate pricing conduct, and urge banks to strictly implement the requirement for explicit indications of annualized loan rates so as to protect the rights and interests of consumers. Taking steady steps forward to deepen the market-oriented exchange rate reform, the PBC will continue to improve the managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, maintain the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate, and explore the role of the exchange rate in macroeconomic management and as an automatic stabilizer for the balance of payments. The PBC will strengthen macroprudential management to stabilize market expectations and to keep the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. Steps will be accelerated to develop the foreign exchange market and to provide services of exchange rate risk management for import and export companies with authentic needs. Enterprises will be guided to be risk neutral in financial management and to manage exchange rate risks with foreign exchange derivatives. Efforts will be made to steadily advance the convertibility of the RMB under the capital account, improve the policy framework and the infrastructure for cross-border use of the RMB, and promote the use of the RMB in cross-border trade and investment. Fifth, the PBC will improve the financial market system and enable financial markets to play an effective role in stabilizing growth, promoting structural adjustments, advancing reform, and guarding against risks. Institution building in the management of financial bonds will be strengthened to establish a tiered and categorized shelf-like system for the management of financial bond issuances. Measures will be taken to support equity financing and bond financing by private enterprises and to enhance the capacity of the financial sector to serve the real economy. Work will be done to push for uniform standards for information disclosures of corporate debenture bonds and to improve the relevant regulations. The mechanism of bond default risk prevention and resolution will be improved in line with marketoriented and law-based principles. The PBC will enhance coordination and interconnectivity between financial market infrastructures, and push forward with the building of custodian banks and trade repositories to ensure that financial markets are generally stable while performing safely and efficiently. Active but prudent steps will be taken to promote an institutional and systemic opening-up of the bond market and to introduce more medium- and long-term investors into the market. Sixth, the PBC will deepen the financial supply-side structural reforms and improve the modern financial system to make it highly adaptable, competitive, and inclusive. Reforms of financial institutions will be further promoted. More work will be done to promote full implementation of the reform plans for development financial institutions and policy banks so as to improve their governance system, set strict boundaries for their businesses, and better bring out their role in line with the management practices of financial institutions. Reforms of large commercial banks and other large financial enterprises will deepen so as to improve their corporate governance, regulate the relationship between the general meeting of shareholders, the board of directors, the board of supervisors, and management, and improve authorized management, thereby giving rise to effective decision-making, implementation as well as checks and balances, and enhancing their business management and risk control capabilities. Seventh, the PBC will make continued efforts to fight the tough battle of forestalling and defusing major financial risks so as to ensure that risks are generally controllable and steadily subsiding, and to firmly defend the bottom line that no systemic risk should occur. Under the leadership of the State Council Financial Stability and Development Committee, while consolidating the success already achieved, the PBC will adhere to the fundamental principles of maintaining overall stability, taking a coordinated approach, adopting differentiated measures, and defusing bombs with precision. It will consider new developments in the macroeconomic situation from a holistic perspective, focus on key issues, and manage the pace of work properly so as to ensure that the tasks of defusing risks set forth in the decisions of the CPC Central Committee will be fulfilled as scheduled, thereby creating a favorable financial environment for completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects in 2020. Part 1. Money and Credit AnalysisSince the beginning of 2020, the People's Bank of China (PBC) has resolutelyimplemented the decisions and arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and theState Council. With the sound monetary policy more flexible and appropriate, andcountercyclical adjustments yielding significant results, financing costs continuouslydeclined, the credit structure was further improved, and the quality and efficiency offinancial services for the real economy were increasingly higher. The PBC haseffectively supported pandemic containment, work and production resumption, anddevelopment of the real economy. I. Liquidity in the banking system was adequate at a reasonable levelIn H1 2020, facing complicated and grave domestic and international situations, inaccordance with the requirement that sound monetary policies should be more flexibleand appropriate, the PBC employed a monetary policy toolkit that included requiredreserve ratio (RRR) cuts, the medium-term lending facility (MLF), central banklending and central bank discounts to release medium and long-term liquidity. It alsohad a flexible grasp of the intensity and pace of open market operations (OMOs) tokeep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level. In addition, with strengthenedexpectation management, money market interest rates were guided to move smoothlyaround OMO rates.II. Lending by financial institutions grew relatively rapidly, with the creditstructure optimized and lending rates moving downwardsThe PBC guided credit supply toward the needs of enterprises to resume work andproduction. It continued to push down financing costs and promote lending in favor ofmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), thus providing targetedsupport for pandemic containment, work and production resumption, anddevelopment of the real economy. Outstanding loans issued by financial institutions indomestic and foreign currencies grew 13.0 percent year on year to RMB171.3 trillionat the end of June, up RMB12.7 trillion from the beginning of the year and anacceleration of RMB2.9 trillion from the corresponding period of 2019. OutstandingRMB-denominated loans grew 13.2 percent year on year to RMB165.2 trillion, upRMB12.1 trillion from the beginning of the year and an acceleration of RMB2.4trillion from the corresponding period of 2019. The improvement in the credit structure and stronger support for the financing ofmicro and small business (MSB) met enterprises鈥  liquidity needs and the entiresociety鈥檚 demands for funds to contain the pandemic. Loans to enterprises and publicentities grew by RMB8.8 trillion from the beginning of the year, a year-on-yearincrease of RMB2.5 trillion. Medium and long-term loans to the manufacturing sectorgained 24.7 percent, hitting a record high within a decade.

In general, the upward anddownward float of the loan rates around the LPR moved downward as a wholecompared with that in March.The sustained easy monetary policies of the developed economies prompted adecrease in the interest rates on foreign-currency deposits and loans. In June, theweighted average interest rates on demand and large-value USD-denominateddeposits with maturities within 3 months registered 0.20 percent and 0.75 percentrespectively, down 0.01 percentage points and 0.68 percentage points respectivelyfrom March.

The first half of 2020 witnessed a net cashinjection of RMB227 billion into the economy, a rise of RMB289.8 billion year onyear. According to preliminary statistics, outstanding aggregate financing to the realeconomy (AFRE) reached RMB271.8 trillion at the end of June, up 12.8 percent yearon year and an acceleration of 2.1 percentage points over the end of the previous year. In H1 2020, the incremental AFRE reached RMB20.83 trillion on a cumulative basis, an increase of RMB6.22 trillion year on year. Growth of the AFRE was characterizedby the following features. First, RMB loans saw a substantially larger year-on-yearincrease. Second, the drop in entrusted loans narrowed, and the year-on-year growthin undiscounted bankers鈥  acceptances expanded. Third, both corporate bonds andequity financing increased considerably compared with the previous year. Fourth, government bonds saw a significantly larger year-on-year increase. Fifth, the declineof asset-backed securities of depository financial institutions accelerated from theprevious year, while the growth of written-off loans accelerated. IV. The RMB exchange rate remained basically stable, and cross-border RMBtransactions continued to growSince the beginning of 2020, cross-border capital flows and foreign exchange supplyand demand have been basically in equilibrium, with market expectations generallystable. Based on market supply and demand, the RMB exchange rate moved in bothdirections and remained basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. In H1, the RMB exchange rate generally held steady against a basket of currencies. At theend of June, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) RMB exchange-rateindex and the RMB exchange-rate index based on the special drawing rights (SDRs)basket closed at 92.05 and 90.78, up 0.72 percent and down 1.12 percent fromend-2019, respectively. According to calculations by the Bank for InternationalSettlements (BIS), as of the end of June, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER)and the real effective exchange rate (REER) of the RMB appreciated 0.50 percent anddepreciated 0.43 percent, respectively.

RMB cross-border receipts and payments under thecapital account posted RMB9.6 trillion, up 47 percent year on year. Part 2. Monetary Policy OperationsSince the beginning of 2020, amid the daunting challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the PBC has adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialismwith Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, resolutely implemented the decisions andarrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, andadopted a sound monetary policy in a more flexible and appropriate manner. Based onthe current situation highlighted by pandemic containment and work and productionresumption, the PBC flexibly managed the intensity, pace, and focus of adjustments, remained committed to the specific goals of maintaining an appropriate aggregatepolicy, substantially lowering financing costs and supporting the real economy inresponse to the highly uncertain situation, and shore up the economy to tap into itspotential so as to create a favorable environment for ensuring stability on six fronts, namely, employment, the financial sector, foreign trade, foreign investment, domesticinvestment and expectations, and maintaining security in six areas, namely, employment, people鈥  s basic livelihood, operations of market entities, food and energysecurity, stable industrial and supply chains, as well as the normal functioning ofprimary-level governments. I. Conducting open market operations in a flexible mannerFlexibly conducting open market operations (OMOs) and maintaining liquidityadequate at a reasonable level. In the first half of 2020, in addition to cutting therequired reserve ratio (RRR) three times, conducting the medium-term lending facility(MLF) operations, and providing central bank lending and central bank discounts, thePBC conducted OMOs in a flexible manner and maintained adequate liquidity at areasonable level in the banking system, which was neither loosened nor tightened, with the excess reserve ratio of the system approximating 1.5鈥 2 percent. Since thebeginning of Q2, to cushion the impact of short-term factors such as intensivegovernment bond issuances as well as the annual settlement and payment of thecorporate income tax, the PBC has managed well the strength and pace of OMOs andhas ironed out short-term liquidity fluctuations in a timely manner. A series of 14-dayrepo operations has been conducted since mid-June, preemptively meeting theheightened liquidity demand at mid-year, stabilizing market expectations, and thusproviding a favorable liquidity environment for government bond issuances. The OMO rates remained stable. Since the beginning of Q2, the 7-day repo rate hasremained unchanged at 2.20 percent, which has neither declined due to monetaryeasing adopted by the developed economies nor increased, sending a clear signal ofstability. In the meanwhile, various means were taken to strengthen expectationsmanagement and to guide money market rates to move smoothly around the OMOrates, hence bringing into play the role of OMO rates as the center of short-termmarket rates. In Q2, money market rates witnessed stable movement in general. InApril, due to the zero interest rate policy and the quantitative easing adopted by thecentral banks of the developed economies, participants in the interbank market pushed down money market rates, which once even deviated from the OMO rates. In lateMay, with market expectations returning to rationality, money market rates reboundedand stayed close to the OMO rates. In Q2, the 7-day rate (DR007), which is a fundingrate between depository institutions in the interbank market, averaged 1.66 percent, 45basis points lower than that in Q1. At end-June, the DR007 stood at 2.30 percent, 26basis points lower than that at the same time last year. Continuously conducting central bank bill swap (CBS) operations. In order tosupport banks to replenish capital through perpetual bond issuances and to furtherimprove the market liquidity of perpetual bonds issued by banks, the PBC conductedCBS operations three times in Q2, with the total amount registering RMB15 billion. The maturity of each operation was three months, at a fixed rate of 0.1 percent. Sincethe beginning of 2020, the PBC has conducted CBS operations once in each month, totaling RMB31 billion. The perpetual bonds swapped with the PBC included notonly those issued by large-sized commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banksbut also those issued by urban commercial banks and rural commercial banks. TheCBS operations played a positive role in improving liquidity on the secondary marketof bank-issued perpetual bonds and supporting the issuance of perpetual bonds toreplenish capital by banks, especially small and medium-sized banks. Issuing central bank bills in Hong Kong on a regular basis. In Q2, the PBC issuedthree batches of RMB-denominated central bank bills in Hong Kong, totaling RMB40 billion. Specifically, the 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year bills registered RMB20 billion, RMB10 billion, and RMB10 billion, respectively. In H1 2020, the PBC issued inHong Kong six batches of RMB-denominated central bank bills in a total amount ofRMB80 billion, with the outstanding balance standing at RMB80 billion as ofend-June. The regular issuance of RMB-denominated central bank bills in Hong Kongnot only enriched RMB investment products with high credit ratings and RMBliquidity management tools on the Hong Kong market but also fostered the offshoreissues of RMB bonds by other entities, thus promoting the use of RMB as aninternational currency. II. Conducting Medium-term Lending Facility and Standing Lending FacilityoperationsWell-timed Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) operations were conducted. The supply of monetary base was ensured and MLF rates declined. In the first half of2020, the PBC conducted a total of RMB1 trillion of MLF operations, all with amaturity of one year. Specifically, the amount of MLF operations posted RMB400billion in Q2. At end-June, the outstanding MLF registered RMB3.55 trillion, RMB140 billion less than that at the beginning of the year. The one-year MLF ratedeclined by 20 basis points from the previous operation to 2.95 percent on April 15and levelled off in May and June. The MLF rate, as the mid-term policy rate, is thecenter of the mid-term market rates. Market interest rates, such as the governmentbond yield curve and interbank certificates of deposit, fluctuate around the MLF rate. As the MLF rate represents the banks鈥  average marginal mid-term funding cost, itsdecline meant the latter dropped, which was helpful to bring down the corporatelending rates through the LPR and to foster lower social financing costs. Standing Lending Facility (SLF) operations were conducted in a timely manner. The demand for short-term liquidity of locally incorporated financial institutions wasmet in the full amount, with the SLF playing the role as the ceiling of the interest ratecorridor, thus promoting the smooth operation of the money market. In the first half of2020, the PBC conducted a total of RMB151.4 billion SLF operations, of whichRMB48.7 billion of operations were conducted in Q2. The balance of SLF operationsregistered RMB7.3 billion at end-June. On April 10, the overnight, 7-day, and1-month SLF rates were lowered by 30 basis points to reach 3.05 percent, 3.2 percent, and 3.55 percent, respectively. III. Enhancing monetary and credit support to offset the impact of theIn accordance with the decisions and arrangements of the CPC CentralCommittee and the State Council, the PBC coordinated pandemic containmentwith economic and social development, rolled out a series of monetary and creditpolicies, and strived to stabilize businesses and secure employment, in an aim toensure stability on six fronts and to maintain security in six areas. First, liquidity remained adequate at a reasonable level. RMB1.7 trillion ofshort-term liquidity was pumped into the financial market when it reopened after theSpring Festival vacation, which effectively stabilized market expectations. The threereductions of the RRR released RMB1.75 trillion of long-term funds. Second, RMB1.8 trillion of central bank lending and central bank discounts wasprovided in three steps, and coordinated efforts were made to promote pandemiccontainment and economic and social development. In the first half of 2020, thePBC provided RMB300 billion of special central bank lending, RMB500 billion ofcentral bank lending and central bank discounts, and RMB1 trillion of central banklending and central bank discounts in three steps, with a combined quota of RMB1.8trillion, to support containment of the pandemic, provision of medical supplies anddaily necessities, resumption of work and production, and development of the realeconomy, especially the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). As ofend-June, the policy of RMB300 billion of special central bank lending and RMB500billion of central bank lending and central bank discounts had been fully implemented. As of July 27, central bank lending and central bank discounts in the amount ofRMB1 trillion had supported locally incorporated banks to issue a total of RMB457.3billion in loans at preferential interest rates, thus playing a vital role in supportingpandemic containment as well as work and production resumption. Third, two monetary policy instruments that directly support the real economywere launched to bolster the development of small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) and to stabilize businesses and secure employment. On June 1, 2020, thePBC, jointly with the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), Ministry of Finance (MOF), the National Development and Reform Commission(NDRC), and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), issuedthe Notice on Extending the Policy of Provisional Deferred Repayments of LoanPrincipal and Interest for Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (YinfaNo.122 [2020]), stipulating that, for the principal of inclusive micro and smallbusiness (MSB) loans that were to mature within the year and for the accrued interestof inclusive MSB loans outstanding at end-2020, banking financial institutions shallgrant deferred repayments of the principal and interest for a certain period of time to enterprises upon application, extending the repayment deadline up to March 31, 2021, with the penalty interest waived. On the same day, the Notice of the PBC on IssuesRegarding Instruments Supporting Deferred Repayments of Inclusive Loans for Microand Small Businesses (Yinfa No.124 [2020]) was issued, which stipulated that thePBC launched an instrument in support of deferred repayments of inclusive MSBloans, set up RMB40 billion of central bank lending, and provided an incentiveequivalent to approximately 1 percent of the deferred loan principal to locallyincorporated banks, so as to ease the MSBs鈥  pressure of deferring the repayment ofthe loan principal and interest. In addition, the Notice of the PBC on Issues Regardingthe Support Scheme for Inclusive Unsecured Loans for Micro and Small Businesses(Yinfa No.125 [2020]) was issued on the same day, stating that the PBC launched asupport scheme for unsecured inclusive MSB loans, in which RMB400 billion ofcentral bank lending would be set up and banks would be provided with favorablefunding equivalent to 40 percent of the unsecured loans that they had actually issued, thus substantively easing the financing strains on the MSBs. The two new instrumentsdirectly link monetary policy operations with financial institutions鈥  support forinclusive MSBs, which ensures targeted adjustments and provides vigorous supportfor stabilizing businesses and securing employment. Fourth, synergy in the financial system was forged. Financial institutions wereguided to provide differentiated financial services to areas with different COVID-19alert levels. Major state-owned banks were urged to ramp up support for inclusiveMSBs, special credit support from policy banks was put in place, and locallyincorporated banks were guided to serve local communities effectively. IV. Lowering the required reserve ratio for small and medium-sized banksThe RRR for small and medium-sized banks and the interest rate on excessreserves were cut to support the development of the real economy. On April 3, thePBC announced an RRR cut of 1 percentage point for rural credit cooperatives, ruralcommercial banks, rural cooperative banks, village banks, and city commercial banksthat operate solely within their own provincial-level administrative regions. This cuttook effect in two phases, with a cut of 0.5 percentage points each time, on April 15and May 15 respectively. About RMB400 billion of long-term funds was freed up bythe cut. Meanwhile, starting from April 7, the interest rate on excess reservesdeposited in the central bank by financial institutions was cut from 0.72 percent to0.35 percent. At end-June, the excess reserve ratio for financial institutions stood at1.6 percent, representing a year-on-year reduction of 0.4 percentage points and areduction of 0.5 percentage points from end-March when the cut had not beenannounced. All the above-mentioned policies have contributed to boosting the banks鈥  credit support for MSMEs, enhancing the financial institutions鈥  efficiency in capitaluse, bringing down social financing costs, and shoring up the real economy. V. Further improving the macroprudential policy frameworkThe role of the macroprudential assessment (MPA) was effectively brought intoplay to optimize the credit structure and promote the financial supply-sidestructural reform. In Q2 2020, in line with the requirement of the central economicwork conference that medium and long-term funding be increased for themanufacturing sector and the difficulties faced by private firms and MSMEs bealleviated in terms of accessing affordable funding, the PBC further strengthened theassessment of financing for MSBs, private firms, and the manufacturing sector in theMPA, and guided financial institutions to ramp up credit support for them. Improvements were made in the assessment on the use of the loan prime rate (LPR), and the LPR reform continued to play its part in pushing down the loan rates. The supervisory framework for systemically important financial institutions(SIFIs) was improved. In line with the Guiding Opinions on Improving theSupervision of Systemically Important Financial Institutions, the PBC took the lead inthe formulation of Assessment Measures on Systemically Important Banks, clarifyingassessment indicators, process, and the division of work, which helped improve thesupervisory framework for systemically important banks in China. VI. Giving full play to the role of structural monetary policy instrumentsThe PBC actively used central bank lending in support of agriculture and MSBs, central bank discounts, pledged supplementary lending (PSL), and other policytools to guide financial institutions to step up support for key areas and weaklinks in the national economy, such as MSBs, private firms, agriculture, ruralareas, and rural residents, as well as poverty alleviation. Central bank lending tosupport special poverty alleviation projects was made good use of to increase creditsupply to areas of extreme poverty, including the 鈥渢hree autonomous regions鈥 , i.e., Tibet, four prefectures in southern Xinjiang, and the Tibetan areas in four provinces, and the 鈥渢hree autonomous prefectures鈥 , i.e., Linxia in Gansu, Liangshan in Sichuan, and Nujiang in Yunnan, to cut down on the financing costs in these areas as well as toachieve targeted poverty alleviation. In Q2, RMB8 billion of central bank lending forspecial poverty alleviation projects was provided, with the nationwide balancestanding at RMB21.9 billion at end-June. Starting from July 1, 2020, the interest rateson central bank lending to support agriculture and MSBs and the central bankdiscount rate were reduced by 25 basis points. After this reduction, the three-month, six-month, and one-year central bank lending to support agriculture and MSBs posted1.95 percent, 2.15 percent, and 2.25 percent, respectively, while the central bankdiscount rate was 2 percent. At end-June, outstanding central bank lending to support agriculture stood at RMB337.2 billion. Outstanding central bank lending for MSBsand for poverty alleviation posted RMB621.4 billion and RMB153.7 billion, respectively. Outstanding central bank discounts registered RMB433.6 billion. In thefirst half of 2020, the PBC made a net withdrawal of PSLs in the amount of RMB28.3billion from policy and development banks, with the net withdrawal in Q2 totalingRMB48.5 billion and the outstanding PSL registering RMB3.509 trillion at end-June. A targeted medium-term lending facility (TMLF) operation was conducted. TheTMLF provided a stable and long-term funding source for financial institutions toexpand credit supply to private firms and MSBs at preferential interest rates. In April, the PBC conducted one-year TMLF operations at an interest rate of 2.95 percent, totaling RMB56.1 billion. The interest rate was 20 basis points lower than that in theprevious operation, and it was at the same level as the latest MLF rate. At the end ofJune, the outstanding TMLF stood at RMB594.3 billion. Box 1 Improving the Structural Monetary Policy ToolkitIn 2020, acting on the fundamental requirement of the financial sector serving the realeconomy, the PBC continued to improve the structural monetary policy toolkit, deployed structural monetary policy instruments in an innovative manner, providedprecise and targeted financial support, effectively supported pandemic containmentand economic and social development, and ramped up support for key areas and weaklinks in the national economy, all of which have achieved good results. Monetary policy can both play the role of an aggregate policy and be animportant force in support of economic structure adjustments, transformation, and upgrading. Frictions exist in the macroeconomic operation, the market systemfaces the risk of market failure, and micro-market entities are heterogeneous in thereal world. If aggregate indicators are the only focus of monetary policy, greaterstructural distortions will arise, making aggregate targets difficult to attain. Therefore, the introduction of an incentive compatibility mechanism helps structural monetarypolicies to achieve the following goals, i.e., enhancing efficiency of capital use, promoting the flow of credit resources into key areas and weak links that have greaterdemand and vitality, leveraging the social and economic efficiency of financialresources, boosting social welfare, and contributing to better aggregate adjustmenteffects. The PBC has long been successful in implementing structural monetary policyinstruments. In wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, the central banks in theadvanced economies came to realize that financial markets were flawed, and manybegan to adopt structural monetary policies, including the Targeted Longer-termRefinancing Operations (TLTRO) of the ECB, and the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) of the Bank of England. The PBC has increased the intensity of structural monetary policy since thebeginning of this year. First, the required reserve framework featuring 鈥渢hreetranches and two preferential treatments鈥  was further improved. The targeted RRR cutfor inclusive finance on March 16 released about RMB550 billion of long-term fundsto support the issuance of loans for inclusive finance. On April 3, the RRR cut forsmall and medium-sized financial institutions, including rural commercial banks, andfor city commercial banks that operate solely within their own provincial-leveladministrative regions was announced, releasing about RMB400 billion of long-termfunds. Second, to cushion the impact of the pandemic, special central bank lendingwith a quota of RMR300 billion as well as inclusive central bank lending and centralbank discounts with a quota of RMB500 billion and RMB1 trillion respectively wererolled out successively. By end-June, the policy of RMB300 billion special centralbank lending and of the RMB500 billion central bank lending and central bankdiscounts had been fully implemented. Specifically, the RMB300 billion quota ofcentral bank lending supported banks in issuing a cumulative RMB283.4 billion ofpreferential loans to a total of 7,597 nationwide and local key enterprises. TheRMB500 billion quota of central bank lending and central bank discounts supportedlocally incorporated banks to issue a cumulative RMB498.3 billion of preferentialloans to a total of 590,000 enterprises. Central bank lending and central bankdiscounts with a quota of RMB1 trillion were put in place to make an orderlycontinuation. By July 27, a cumulative RMB457.3 billion of preferential loans hadbeen issued to a total of 780,000 businesses and rural households, with each borrowerreceiving an average of RMB590,000. Third, two monetary policy instruments thatcan provide more direct support for the real economy have been developed. In orderto encourage banks to ease MSMEs鈥  pressures to repay loans, a supportive instrumentto defer the repayment of inclusive loans for MSBs was set up, and RMB40 billion ofcentral bank lending was provided. This move is estimated to support locallyincorporated banks to extend inclusive MSB loan principal approximating RMB3.7trillion. Another supportive scheme to provide unsecured inclusive loans for MSBswas created to alleviate the pain of MSBs with no guarantees in accessing loans, in anattempt to raise the share of unsecured MSB loans. Under this scheme, the RMB400billion of central bank lending is expected to drive locally incorporated banks to issueabout RMB1trillion of unsecured loans for inclusive MSBs. Recently, the PBC, forthe first time, conducted operations under this supportive scheme for eligibleunsecured loans issued by locally incorporated banks from March 1 to May 31, 2020, covering 1,170 locally incorporated banks and 390,000 MSBs nationwide. Theprincipal of eligible unsecured loans reached RMB70.9 billion, with a weightedaverage maturity of 13.6 months and a weighted average interest rate of 6.76 percent. This first operation to support unsecured inclusive loans provided RMB27 billion tolocally incorporated bank and the first interest rate swap operation of the supportiveinstrument for deferred repayments of inclusive MSB loans will be conducted in the near future. It has been proved that structural monetary policy functions effectively infollowing three respects. First, a positive incentive mechanism for financialinstitutions has been set up. The design of the incentive compatibility mechanismenables liquidity injections to play the function of enhancing structural adjustments ofbank credit, to effectively guide the behavior of financial institutions, to respond toemergency shocks such as the pandemic, and to ramp up the support of finance to keyareas in the real economy. Second, a reimbursement-based mechanism to optimizefinancial institutions鈥  credit has been set up. Through the provision of low-cost fundsto financial institutions with partial or total refunding, financial institutions are guidedto step up credit support for the key areas and weak links in the national economy. Third, the interest rate plays a guiding role. By bringing into play the role ofstructural monetary policy in guiding the movement of the interest rate, the centralbank has strengthened effective guidance of the interest rate and lowered socialfinancing costs. Since the beginning of 2020, financing for MSMEs grew in bothvolume and coverage and was offered at lower prices. At end-June, outstandinginclusive loans for MSBs grew by 26.5 percent year on year, 3.4 percentage pointshigher than the growth at the end of the previous year. The interest rate of corporateloans averaged 4.64 percent, 0.48 percentage points lower than that in last December. Inclusive loans for MSBs supported 29.64 million MSB entities, a year-on-yearincrease of 21.8 percent. Going forward, the PBC will continue to leverage the role of structural monetarypolicy instruments in providing precise and targeted financial support, enable thepolicies to provide more direct support for the real economy, guide financialinstitutions to ramp up support for MSBs and private firms, earnestly fulfill its dutiesto ensure stability on six fronts and comprehensively implement the task ofmaintaining security in six areas, so as to promote a virtuous cycle between financeand the real economy. VII. Leveraging the structural guidance role of credit policiesWith an orientation toward high-quality development, the PBC further optimized thefinancial structure, guided financial institutions to continuously enhance their supportto key areas of the national economy and to weak links, and intensified efforts tostabilize businesses and secure employment in an attempt to ensure success in thebattle of poverty elimination and in the building of a moderately prosperous society inall respects. First, comprehensive mobilization and deployment were carried outto provide support for stabilizing businesses and securing employment by thefinancial sector. Based on special research on the subject of 鈥渟ecuring market entities鈥 , the PBC published the Guidelines on the Work of Stabilizing Businesses andSecuring Employment by the Financial Sector. Monetary policy tools were innovatedto provide more direct support for the real economy. The PBC enhanced creditsupport for market entities and released guiding opinions on further strengtheningfinancial services to MSMEs, jointly with other authorities, in a bid to raise the scale, reduce the costs, improve the quality, and expand the coverage of these services. ThePBC enhanced support for medium and long-term financing of the manufacturingindustry and established a coordination and negotiation mechanism among ministriesfor medium and long-term loans for the manufacturing industry. The PBC published anotice on enhancing interest support to secured loans for start-ups and stepped upfinancial support for the employment and entrepreneurship of special social groups, such as veterans, college graduates, and migrant workers returning home to startbusinesses. Second, financial services were provided to effectively promotetargeted poverty alleviation. The PBC strengthened the application of policy toolsand its corresponding guidance, allocated more financial resources to extremely poorareas as well as to counties that were still labeled as poverty-stricken, enhancedmanagement of potential risks with respect to poverty alleviation by the financialsector, and promoted the establishment of a long-term mechanism for providinghigh-quality and sustainable financial support for poverty alleviation. Third, financial services were further strengthened to support rural revitalization. Measures were taken to provide financial support for safeguarding spring farming, tillage preparation, and hog production, and for securing the effective supply ofessential agricultural products. Financial institutions were guided to reinforce supportfor agricultural fixed-asset investments and the construction of high-standardfarmland. Efforts were made to enhance financial support for warehouse logisticsenterprises in a bid to boost the quality and efficiency of circulation businesses. Financial services for new-type agricultural business entities were stepped up tofacilitate the integration of small farmers into the agricultural industry chain. Fourth, coordinated regional development was promoted. Focused on the planning, construction, reforms and development of Xiongan New Area, efforts were made toimprove the system of financial supportive policies and guide financial institutions toprovide more financial resources for key areas and major projects through multiplechannels. Continuous efforts were made to provide better financial services for majorregional development strategies, such as the coordinated development ofBeijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, theconstruction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, thedevelopment of regional integration of the Yangtze River Delta, and the constructionof Hainan Pilot Free Trade Zone and Free Trade Port. VIII. Deepening the market-oriented interest rate reformThe PBC advanced the LPR reform and lowered the loan rates for enterprises. The application of the LPR was further promoted. The one-year and above-five-year LPR reported in June were 3.85 percent and 4.65 percent, respectively, down 20 basispoints and 10 basis points from March, respectively. Following the LPR trendingdownward, loan rates were notably reduced, with a decline larger than that of the LPR. In line with market-oriented and law-based principles, the PBC promoted a shift in thepricing benchmark for outstanding floating-rate loans in an orderly manner. By theend of June, 55 percent of outstanding loans had completed the shift in the pricingbenchmark, including 76 percent of the outstanding corporate loans. During thetransition, the interest rates on loans were somewhat lowered, which could directlyreduce the enterprises鈥  interest expenses. From the beginning of the next price-settingperiod, enterprises can enjoy additional policy benefits brought about by the loweredLPR, which will further notably reduce their financing costs. A market-based LPR canbetter reflect changes in market supply and demand, which will significantly improvethe efficiency of the transmission of monetary policy to loan interest rates. Meanwhile, the LPR reform plays an important role in the market-based reform of deposit interestrates. Box 2 Improvements in the Interest Rate Transmission MechanismIn August 2019, in accordance with the arrangements of the State Council, the PBCreformed and improved the formation mechanism for the LPR which allowed panelbanks to make quotes by adding some basis points to the MLF rate. The number ofbasis points added was mainly determined by factors such as the funding costs ofbanks, market demand and supply, and the risk premium. As the central bank鈥檚 medium-term policy interest rate, the MLF rate represents themarginal funding cost of the banking system to obtain medium-term base money fromthe central bank. Since the central bank is in charge of supplying base money, itspolicy interest rates undoubtedly constitute the basis of market interest rate pricingand serve as the pivot of market interest rate movements. Although the proportion offunds provided by the MLF and other monetary policy instruments is not high amongthe banks鈥  liabilities, it is the marginal amount rather than the total amount that playsa decisive role in affecting market interest rates. Under the credit money system ofbanks, the entities of money creation are banks. After creating deposits by expandingassets, banks need more base money to satisfy the reserve requirements. Therefore, there exists a continuous demand for base money. As the central bank takes charge ofbase money supply, it only needs a few necessary operations to exert a decisivemarginal impact on the market interest rates rather than operations in huge amount tomake central bank funds the main liabilities of the banks. The MLF rate as themedium-term policy interest rate, together with the OMO rate as the short-term policyinterest rate, forms the system of policy interest rates of the central bank, whichconveys signals of central bank鈥檚 interest rate adjustments. In addition, as its maturitymatches that of the LPR, the MLF is suitable to be used by banks as an importantreference for loan pricing, i.e., the price of the funds provided by the banking system for the real economy. Taking into account their respective funding costs and otherfactors, panel banks can make quotes by adding some basis points to the MLF rate. Infact, the spread between the LPR and the MLF rate is not totally fixed, which reflectsthe market-oriented feature of the panel banks鈥  quotation. Affected by various factors, the interest rates of interbank CDs, repos, interbank lending, and other interbankfinancing instruments, as well as the yield curve of treasury bonds, fluctuate in theshort-term. However, in the medium and long-term run, they will mainly fluctuatearound the central bank鈥檚 policy interest rates. Since the reform, the LPR quotation has gradually trended downward, which hasreflected well the direction of the central bank鈥檚 monetary policy and the demand andsupply of market funds. It has not only become a key reference for loan interest rateprice-setting by banks but also has been internalized into the funds transfer pricing(FTP) of the banks鈥  internal funds. The original implicit floor for loan interest rateshas been completely removed, with the transmission channel for monetary policyeffectively smoothed. An interest rate transmission mechanism featuring 鈥淢LFrates鈫扡PR鈫抣oan interest rates鈥  has been fully demonstrated. Meanwhile, the LPR reform has effectively promoted the market-oriented reform ofdeposit interest rates. Although no adjustment has been made to the benchmarkdeposit interest rates since October 2015, the caps and floors of deposit interest rateshave both been removed, so the actual deposit interest rates executed by banks can beset on a discretionary and floating-rate basis. With the deepening of the LPR reform, loan interest rates have become more market-oriented and connected to the markets. Due to the remarkable decrease in loan interest rates after the reform, banks willreasonably lower the costs of their liabilities in an attempt to match asset incomes. Subsequently, there will be fewer incentives for banks to attract deposits at highinterest rates, thus guiding the decline of deposit interest rates. In fact, against thebackdrop of unchanged benchmark deposit interest rates, banks鈥  deposit interest ratesof all maturities have recently decreased. In June, a number of large-scale banksvoluntarily lowered the issuance interest rates on 3-year and 5-year negotiable CDs, followed by the downward adjustments by joint-stock banks accordingly and thedecline of deposit interest rates in some local incorporated banks. In June 2020, theaverage weighted interest rate of negotiable CDs of large-scale state-owned banks andjoint-stock banks registered 2.64 percent and 2.71 percent, respectively, 30 basispoints and 34 basis points lower than those of December 2019. The yield ofrepresentative money market funds has fallen below 1.5 percent, lower than the 1-yearbenchmark deposit interest rate. The yields of banks鈥  structural deposits and wealthmanagement products have also declined. This has fully illustrated the effectivenessof the market mechanism in reducing deposit interest rates through the LPR reform, the improved efficiency of monetary policy transmission to deposit interest rates, andthe significant progress made in the market-oriented deposit interest rate reform. IX. Improving the market-oriented RMB exchange rate regimeThe PBC continued to advance the market-oriented exchange rate reform and toimprove the managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply anddemand with reference to a basket of currencies. It maintained the flexibility of theexchange rate and gave play to the role of the exchange rate as an automatic stabilizerin adjusting the macro economy and the balance of payments. In the meantime, thePBC attached importance to guiding expectations and keeping the RMB exchangerate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. In H1, the highest andlowest CNY central parities were 6.8606 and 7.1316 against the USD, respectively. During the 117 trading days, the RMB appreciated on 60 days and depreciated on 57days. The biggest intraday appreciation and depreciation were 0.65 percent (456 bps)and 0.76 percent (530 bps), respectively. The RMB exchange rate against other majorinternational currencies floated two-ways with both appreciations and depreciations. At end-June, the central parities of the RMB against the dollar, the euro, and theJapanese yen had depreciated 1.46 percent, 1.83 percent, and 2.62 percentrespectively from end-2019, while the RMB had appreciated 5.00 percent against thepound. From the RMB exchange rate regime reform in 2005 to end-June 2020, theRMB against the dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen appreciated by a cumulativetotal of 16.91 percent, 25.79 percent, and 11.02 percent respectively. Direct RMBtrading was buoyant on the interbank foreign exchange market with steady liquidity, which helped lower the exchange costs of micro economic entities and facilitatebilateral trade and investment. As of end-June, under the bilateral currency-swap agreements between the PBC andforeign monetary authorities, the latter utilized a total of RMB32.736 billion, and theformer utilized an equivalent of USD431 million denominated in foreign currencies. These operations played an active role in promoting bilateral trade and investment. X. Promoting resolution of financial risks in a prudent and orderly manner anddeepening the reforms of financial institutionsDisposal of high-risk small and medium-sized financial institutions wassuccessfully implemented. The PBC actively defused hidden risks in some citycommercial banks, rural commercial banks, and rural credit cooperatives over theyears, and maximally protected the legitimate rights and interests of creditors. Itpromoted provincial-level governments to formulate risk disposal plans for small andmedium-sized financial institutions, according to the principle of 鈥渙ne province, onepolicy鈥 . The reform and restructuring plans of Jinzhou Bank and Hengfeng Bankwere carried out smoothly. Reform of development and policy financial institutions was continuouslydeepened. The PBC comprehensively promoted implementation of the reform plansfor development and policy financial institutions in terms of redefining the scope ofbusiness, promoting the improvement of corporate governance, and strengtheningcapital constraints. The PBC will continue to guide policy financial institutions tostick to their responsibilities and business scope and to give full play to their role insupporting key areas and weak links in the national economy during the critical period, while strengthening risk prevention and control so as to better serve nationaldevelopment strategies. Plans were made in advance and efforts were made to properly deal with therisks of a prospective rise in non-performing loans in the banking industry dueto the impact of COVID-19. COVID-19 has impacted China's economic and socialdevelopment, and has put some downward pressures on the quality of banks鈥  creditassets. As there is a time lag in the reflection of non-performing loans, it is estimatedthat non-performing loans will successively emerge and increase over the upcoming period. The PBC and the CBIRC, together with relevant departments, guided thecommercial banks to conduct stress tests and actively made response plans withregard to the rise of non-performing loans due to the impact of COVID-19. Commercial banks were supported and encouraged to consider changes in thesituation on a dynamic basis, to adopt forward-looking measures, and to reasonablyutilize financial resources. In addition, loss provisions on and write-offs ofnon-performing loans were enhanced in a bid to properly cope with the risks of aprospective rise in non-performing loans due to the impact of COVID-19 and toenhance the capability to withstand risks and serve the real economy. Box 3 Review of the Risk Resolution of Baoshang BankOn May 24, 2019, Baoshang Bank (BSB) was taken over by the PBC and the CBIRCdue to serious credit risks. The working group for the takeover fully executed thebusiness management rights on the BSB and entrusted the China Construction BankCorporation (CCB) to handle its business operations. The risk resolution of the BSBwas steadily promoted for more than one year, and it is now reaching a conclusion. 1. Efforts have been made to appropriately guarantee the creditors鈥  rightsOn the day of the takeover, the BSB had a total of about 4,731,600 clients. Specifically, its personal clients totaled 4,667,700, while enterprises and interbankinstitutional clients amounted to 63,600. The number of clients the BSB serves isquite large, with corporate and interbank clients spreading across the country. Once itis unable to repay its debts on time, a series of chain reactions such as bank runs andfinancial market fluctuations are likely to occur. In order to ensure maximumprotection of the legitimate rights and interests of depositors and other creditors, andto safeguard financial and social stability, after a thorough study, the PBC and theCBIRC decided to have the Deposit Insurance Fund and the PBC provide funds, guaranteeing the principal and interest of personal deposits and the creditor鈥檚 rights ofmost of the institutions to the full amount. Meanwhile, to strengthen market disciplineand gradually break the expectation of rigid repayment while taking into account theacceptability of market entities, 90 percent of large-denomination creditor's rights hasbeen guaranteed on average. Overall, the extent to which the principal and interest ofindividuals and institutions is guaranteed is appropriate, which is not only higher thanthat during the comprehensive management of securities companies in 2004 but alsorelatively high concerning the risk resolution of the same type of internationalinstitutions. 2. Assets and capital verification have been comprehensively conducted In June 2019, to get a clear picture of the BSB, the working group hired anintermediary in a market-based manner to verify the corporate and interbankbusinesses of the BSB on a deal-by-deal basis. Checkups on the assets and liabilities, account clarification, re-evaluation, and capital verification were conducted, in a bidto fully understand the asset conditions, financial position, and business operations ofthe BSB. On the one hand, the results of the assets and capital verification confirmedthat the BSB was faced with huge risks of insolvency and serious credit risks hadalready emerged during the takeover. Without the injection of public funds, the ratioof ordinary guaranteed creditors鈥  rights would be theoretically less than 60 percent. On the other hand, the results have established a solid foundation for subsequentlypromoting the reform and restructuring of the BSB by the working group. 3. Reforms and restructuring of the BSB have been promotedIn October 2019, the reforms and restructuring of the BSB officially began. In orderto minimize the disposal costs, the working group originally hoped that byintroducing strategic investors, and under the precondition of the governmentdepartments not providing public funds for sharing losses, the fund shortages incurredby the BSB鈥檚 insolvency would be compensated for only by the premium of equityacquisition. However, due to the huge loss gap, no strategic investors were willing toparticipate in the restructuring of the BSB unless public funds covered the losses. Toensure the uninterrupted provision of financial services during the reform andrestructuring of the BSB, with the international experience and practices of financialrisk resolution drawn upon, the PBC and the CBIRC finally decided to establish anew bank under the current framework of laws and regulations at home to acquire theBSB so as to promote its reform and restructuring. In the meantime, to guarantee theliquidity safety of the BSB, the PBC provided liquidity support totaling RMB23.5billion to the BSB through a standing lending facility since the takeover, uponacceptance of high-quality collaterals in full amount. In January 2020, the working group entrusted the Beijing Financial Assets Exchange, in accordance with the market-based principle, chose Huishang Bank to acquire thefour BSB branches outside the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and ascertainedthe subscription quota and share price for the shareholders of the newly-establishedbank, namely, Mengshang Bank. On April 30, 2020, Mengshang Bank was officially established and started itsbusiness operations. On the same day, the Announcement on the Transfer of RelevantBusinesses, Assets, and Liabilities of Baoshang Bank Co., Ltd. was issued by theworking group on the BSB鈥檚 takeover, clarifying that businesses, assets, and liabilitiesof the BSB will be transferred to Mengshang Bank and Huishang Bank, respectively. According to the eighteenth clause of the Deposit Insurance Regulations, the Deposit Insurance Fund will provide fund support for the above-mentioned two banks and willshare responsibility for covering the asset impairment losses of the former BSB, so asto promote the successful acquisition of the BSB by the two banks and to ensure theirsmooth transition to normal operations. 4. Work plan for the next periodAccording to the asset and capital verification results that the former BSB facessevere insolvency, a bankruptcy petition will be filed for the BSB, and liquidation onthe equities of the former shareholders and unguaranteed claims will be conducted ina law-based manner. In addition, the relevant departments are in the process ofholding people concerned accountable based on laws and regulations. XI. Deepening the reforms of foreign exchange administrationForeign exchange administration for trade in goods was further improved. First, measures were taken to guarantee that supplies necessary for battling COVID-19 anddonation funds were put in place in a timely manner. From January 27 to end-Q2 2020, a total of 14,000 foreign exchange receipts and payments under trade in goods wereexpedited across the country through the green channel, totaling USD4.9 billion. Second, the pilot program for facilitating foreign exchange receipts and paymentsunder trade in goods was expanded. By end-Q2 2020, a total of 117,000 foreignexchange receipts and payments were processed under all the pilot programs for 248pilot enterprises in 12 places across the nation, amounting to USD80.9 billion. Third, financial support for the real economy was stepped up. Registration for returnedforeign exchange remittances below USD50,000 was canceled. By end-Q2 2020, atotal of 1,304 cases of returned remittances had been exempt from registration, worthUSD31.2 million. Fourth, innovative development of new forms of trade was boosted. The Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Supporting theDevelopment of New Forms of Trade (Huifa No.11 [2020]) was issued, optimizingforeign exchange receipts and payments for comprehensive foreign trade serviceproviders and enterprises engaged in cross-border e-commerce.By end-Q2 2020, fourbanks witnessing completed transactions had cumulatively received foreign exchangeworth USD8.07 million, involving 242,000 small orders of 1,498 small and microbusinesses. Cross-border financing and investment were further facilitated. First, cross-border trade and investment facilitation was enhanced. In April 2020, theCircular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Optimizing ForeignExchange Administration to Support Foreign-related Business Growth (Huifa No.8[2020]) was released. It simplified operational procedures for foreign exchange businesses, improved foreign exchange services, and promoted the high-qualitygrowth of the foreign-related economy. Second, the limits on the investment quota offoreign institutional investors were lifted. In May 2020, the Regulations on ManagingFunds of Securities and Futures Investments by Foreign Institutional Investors (PBC& SAFE Announcement No.2 [2020]) were issued. They standardized and simplifiedthe administrative requirements for managing funds of securities and futuresinvestments by foreign institutional investors so as to better facilitate the participationof foreign investors in China鈥檚 financial market. Stability in the foreign exchange market was maintained. With regular pandemiccontainment measures remaining in place, efforts were made to coordinate pandemiccontainment with prevention and resolution of financial risks. Monitoring andanalysis of potential risks incurred by cross-border capital flows were strengthened. Emphasis was placed on cracking down on illegal financial activities, such asunderground banks, cross-border gambling, and illegal online foreign exchangetrading. These measures were all aimed at earnestly maintaining order in the foreignexchange market and forestalling and defusing risks of cross-border capital flows soas to ensure stability on six fronts and to maintain security in six areas. In H1 2020, atotal of 714 cases violating the laws and regulations of foreign exchangeadministration were handled, with the total fines amounting to RMB239 million. Part 3. Financial Market ConditionsIn H1 2020, the financial market operated generally smoothly. Money markettransactions were active. The coupon rates of all types of bonds declined, and thevolume of cash bond transactions and issuances expanded. The stock market indicesrebounded from Q1 2020, and the turnover witnessed a year-on-year rise. I. Financial market overview1. Money market transactions were activeMoney market interest rates went down in March and April, followed by a rally inMay. Interest rates generally remained stable within a reasonable range. In June 2020, the monthly weighted average interest rate for interbank lending and pledged reposposted 1.85 percent and 1.89 percent respectively, both up 45 basis points from March2020. The monthly weighted average interest rate for government-backed bond reposamong depository institutions posted 1.75 percent, 14 basis points lower than the monthly weighted average interest rate of pledged repos. At end-June, the overnightand 7-day Shibor posted 1.79 percent and 2.23 percent respectively, up 17 and 8 basispoints from end-March, respectively. The market saw active repo transactions and interbank lending. In H1 2020, thetrading volume of bond repos on the interbank market reached RMB471.2 trillion, representing an average daily turnover of RMB3.9 trillion and a year-on-year increaseof 18.9 percent. The volume of cumulative trading of interbank lending registeredRMB78.4 trillion, with an average daily turnover of RMB648.3 billion and ayear-on-year decrease of 5.2 percent. In terms of the maturity structure, overnightrepos and overnight lending accounted for 84.8 percent and 90.6 percent, respectively, of the total turnover in bond repos and interbank lending, decreasing 0.1 percentagepoints and 1.5 percentage points year on year. The volume of bond repos traded on theexchange markets increased 11.5 percent year on year to RMB128.5 trillion. The interbank CD and negotiable CD businesses witnessed orderly development. InH1 2020, a total of 13,000 interbank CDs were issued on the interbank market, raisingRMB7.8 trillion. The trading volume on the secondary market totaled RMB85.9trillion. At end-June, outstanding interbank CDs reached RMB10.3 trillion. In H12020, the average weighted interest rate of 3-month interbank CDs was 2.21 percent, 16 basis points higher than that of the 3-month Shibor. A total of 31,000 negotiableCDs were issued by financial institutions, raising RMB6.0 trillion, with a decrease ofRMB1.2 trillion year on year. Interest rate swaps were active. In H1 2020, the RMB interest rate swap marketwitnessed 144,363 transactions, increasing 26.7 percent year on year, with the volumeof the notional principal totaling RMB9.9 trillion, an increase of 19.1 percent year onyear. In terms of the maturity structure, contracts with maturities of up to one yeartraded most briskly and the volume of the notional principal posted RMB6.0 trillion, accounting for 60.9 percent of the principal of all maturities.

Part 4. Macroeconomic OverviewI. Global economic and financial developments1. Economic and financial market performance in the major economiesThe COVID-19 took a toll on the global economy in the first half of 2020. Withprogress in reopening, economic indicators in some economies improved gradually. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) further revised down its global growthforecast for 2020 to 鈥 4.9 percent in June, down 1.9 percentage points from the Aprilforecast. Due to the fallout from the pandemic, the major economies saw slower growth in Q1. The quarter-on-quarter GDP growth fell into negative territory in theUS, the euro area, Japan, and the U.K., while year-on-year GDP growth in Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa posted 鈥 0.25 percent, 3.09 percent, 1.6 percent, and鈥 0.1 percent, respectively. In mid-April, the economy showed signs of improvementas a number of countries announced a phased and gradual approach in relaxinglockdown measures and promoted reopening. The Purchasing Managers鈥  Index (PMI)rose across the board toward the middle of this year. The manufacturing PMI in theUS, Turkey, and Brazil all rebounded to above 50 and unemployment pressures eased. International financial market volatility increased. The stock market saw a V-shapedrally, and the US dollar liquidity strains moderated. From March to April, the US DowJones Industrial Average Index and other stock indexes plunged amid the spread ofCOVID-19. However, major stock indexes in the US, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. had rebounded swiftly since May, with the Nasdaq hitting a record high this year. InQ2, global dollar liquidity strains eased, as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) expanded itsbalance sheet significantly. As of June 30, the 1-year US dollar Libor was 0.55percent, shedding 45 basis points (bps) from end-March, while the 1-year Euribor was 鈥 0.23 percent, dipping 6 bps from end-March. 2. Monetary policy of major economiesCentral banks in the major economies maintained interest rates at low levels andscaled up asset purchases. Central banks in the advanced economies, such as the USFed, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BOE), and the Bank ofJapan (BOJ), kept their low interest rates unchanged since Q2. The balance sheets ofthe US Fed, ECB, and BOE expanded quickly as they substantially increased the sizeof their asset purchase programs. The US Fed, ECB, and the central banks in other major advanced economiesintroduced structural emergency liquidity facilities. The US Fed created a number ofstructural tools, such as the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility sinceApril, and adjusted these tools several times to better support pandemic-hit businessesand local governments. The ECB announced pandemic emergency longer-termrefinancing operations and further expanded the pandemic emergency purchaseprogram. Central banks in the emerging market economies continued their rate cuts. In Q2, thecentral banks in Brazil, Russia, Turkey, and South Africa cut rates by a total of 150bps respectively on two occasions, while the Mexican central bank reduced rates threetimes by a total of 150 bps. The Reserve Bank of India, Bank of Korea, and BankIndonesia lowered the benchmark rate by 40 bps, 25 bps, and 25 bps, respectively. Box 4 How to Look at Low Global Interest RateGlobal interest rates have been declining since the 1980s. In the wake of the 2008global financial crisis, the major economies implemented large-scale quantitativeeasing (QE), and some economies also adopted a negative interest rate policy, whichfurther reduced the interest rates. Since the second half of 2019, given the increasingeconomic downside risks and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, central banksaround the world have returned to the easing mode, starting a wave of policy rate cuts. The low interest rate policy has again been transmitted to the financial market wherebond rates have fallen sharply, bonds carrying negative interest rates have expandedrapidly in size, and deposit and lending interest rates have also been impacted. At theend of June 2020, the 10-year government bond yields in the US, Germany, UK, andJapan were 0.66, 鈥 0.5, 0.21, and 0.04 percent respectively, which were down by about 340, 500, 430, and 150 basis points from end-2007, significantly lower than the levelbefore the 2008 global financial crisis and a sharp drop of about 10 percentage pointsfrom the 1981 high. Apart from policy factors, long-term structural factors, such as the decline inpotential economic growth, are the main drivers behind the low global interestrates. From the perspective of real interest rates, the equilibrium interest rate level ismainly related to potential economic growth. Due to the slowing technologicalprogress, the uneven distribution of wealth worldwide, the widening income gap, aging, and the imbalanced industrial structure, the willingness of the advancedeconomies to consume and invest has weakened and the potential economic growthrate has declined. The corresponding equilibrium interest rates, namely the actualneutral interest rates, have come down as well. According to World Bank statistics, in2019 the proportion of the population over 65 years old in the US, the EuropeanUnion, and Japan was 16.2, 20.5, and 28 percent respectively, an increase of 3.7, 3.3, and 7.3 percentage points from 2007. From the perspective of nominal interest rates, long-term inflation and inflation expectation volatility have decreased since the 1980s, which also led nominal interest rates to decline significantly at a pace even greaterthan the real interest rates. Given the lower actual neutral interest rates and the subdued inflation, someadvanced economies have adopted zero or even a negative interest rate policy. However, the low interest rate policy has not worked as expected, and its effectsremain to be seen. Neutral interest rates are an important yardstick in formulatingmonetary policy. In the long run, the interest rate level should remain near the sum ofthe actual neutral interest rates and the inflation targets. Even with the low interestrate policy, inflation in the advanced economies has long been lower than the inflationtargets of the central banks. This can be attributed to three main reasons. First, the low interest rate policy has a limited effect on long-term structural factors, and it isdifficult to change the long-term downward trend of potential economic growth andneutral interest rates. Second, considering that deposit interest rates cannot effectivelybreak through a zero interest rate, the low interest rate policy increases the downwardpressure on the banks鈥  profits and consequently monetary policy cannot be smoothlytransmitted through the banking system in some economies. Studies have shown thatif the policy rate declines and hits the 鈥渞eversal interest rate,鈥  the critical interest rateat which the effects of an accommodative monetary policy will reverse, the excessivenarrowing of interest margins, and the decline in profits may lead commercial banksto cut credits, causing a tightening effect instead. Third, in a low interest rateenvironment, if the policy rate is cut too quickly, it may trigger a Neo-Fisherian effect. Interest rates will fall simultaneously with inflation expectations, while real interestrates will remain unchanged, which will converge toward the liquidity trap andmonetary easing will become ineffective. Excessively low interest rates will also have many negative impacts, such asresource misallocations and funds flowing out of the real economy to the virtualeconomy. First, excessively low interest rates will reduce the efficiency of financialresource allocations and aggravate structural distortions. Interest rates are thetouchstone of market capital allocations. If interest rates are too low, massive fundsmay flow to zombie companies, which will intensify the problem of rising corporatedebt and overcapacity and will hinder technological innovation as well as industrialupgrading and transformation. Second, interest rates that are too low tend toencourage risk-taking behavior and excessive leveraging of financial institutions, which will increase the vulnerability of the financial system. Third, interest rates thatare too low will divert funds from the real economy to the virtual economy. Fundsreleased by a loose monetary policy will increasingly flow to the asset market. Withthe deepening of global economic and financial integration, the spillover and spillbackeffects of monetary policy have become increasingly notable. The low interest ratesand the QE in the major economies may increase risks associated with cross-bordercapital flows and foreign exchange markets to other economies, and heighten thevolatility of financial market prices and exchange rates. At present, the limitations oflow interest rates have caused the monetary authorities in the advanced economies toreflect on and reassess their monetary policy framework. In the medium term, themajor economies will continue with their low interest rate policy, but there is limitedroom for policy rates to fall further. Since the beginning of 2020, the People's Bank of China (PBC) has beenimplementing a normal monetary policy and has maintained interest rates at levelscommensurate with China鈥檚 development stage and economic situation. As a result, the interest rate spread between domestic and foreign currencies has remained at anappropriate range and the attractiveness of RMB assets has increased. 3. Issues and trends that merit attention First, the pandemic containment and the economic reopening should be balancedbetter. Some economies may see a resurge in infections when they reopen theireconomies on a large scale before effectively containing the virus. Second, the risingrisk of insolvency in the corporate sector may trigger a wave of bankruptcy and creditdowngrading. The pandemic has pushed up the number of bankrupt businesses in theUS A number of big names have filed for bankruptcy. Companies in aviation andtourism-related industries are struggling. Third, the global leverage ratio hascontinued to rise. Lockdowns brought the economy to a halt, resulting in lowerincomes and higher debts in the household and corporate sectors. In the meantime, massive containment and bailout measures pushed up the short-term fiscal deficit andgovernment debt levels. The already-high global leverage ratio rose further. Fourth, risks are lurking in the financial markets. Investors are sensitive to expectedmovements in volatile financial markets. Any surprise may unnerve the market. Theemerging market economies need to remain alert to cross-border capital flows andexchange rate risks. According to the Institute of International Finance, the emergingmarkets saw an inflow of USD 32.9 billion into their capital markets in June. Fifth, external instabilities and uncertainties have increased markedly. Geopolitical tensionshave resurfaced and trade frictions among some countries are intensifying. II.

First, the catering industry continuedto expand in size. In 2019, income in the catering industry totaled RMB4.67 trillion, up 9.4 percent year on year, which was 1.5 percentage points higher than that inretailing. Second, the job-creating capacity of the catering industry was furtherenhanced. According to the Communiqu茅 on China鈥檚 4th Economic Census, incorporated enterprises in the catering industry employed 4.234 million staff atend-2018, an increase by 8.8 percent from end-2013. Third, development of thecatering industry is increasingly integrated with information and smart technologies, with new business models emerging in succession, such as takeout and deliveryservices, smart restaurants, and unmanned restaurants. Fourth, food safety in thecatering industry showed an overall good momentum, with an initial atmosphere ofco-governance by government regulation, industry discipline, and public supervision. Nonetheless, the catering industry still faces some challenges and constraints inachieving sustainable and sound development. First, the catering industry is lacking chain store operations and operations of scale. In 2019, the income of cateringenterprises above a designated scale accounted for 20.2 percent of the entire cateringindustry nationwide, which had been declining for seven consecutive years since 2013. Second, the rising cost pressures of rent, labor, and raw materials, plus the fiercemarket competition due to the low entry threshold, squeeze the profit margins ofcatering enterprises. Third, service and management of the catering industry need tobe improved. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the catering industry significantly. With major strategicachievements in pandemic containment, China鈥檚 economy has been normalizing, which will promote the gradual recovery of the catering industry. In H1 2020, incomein the catering industry totaled RMB1.4609 trillion, down 32.8 percent year on year. In particular, the year-on-year decrease of income in Q2 was 23 percentage pointslower than that in Q1, which had improved for three consecutive months. Going forward, driven by the goal of meeting people鈥檚 aspirations for a better life, efforts should be made to improve the adaptability and flexibility of catering supply tochanges in demand on the basis of inheritance and innovation, and to promote thequality and efficiency of the catering industry. On the one hand, support policies incredit, rent, taxes, and fees should be enhanced to stimulate the vitality of cateringenterprises and to allow them to play a better role in ensuring job security and tosafeguard market entities. On the other hand, efforts should also be made to promotethe intensive use of information and smart technologies in the catering industry, tocultivate more large-scale chain brands, to improve service and management, and toenhance the competitiveness of catering enterprises. Part 5. Monetary Policy OutlookI. Outlook for the Chinese economySince the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a heavy blow toChina鈥檚 economic and social development. Under the strong leadership of theCPC Central Committee, the entire nation worked as one and achievedsignificant results in coordinating pandemic containment with economic andsocial development. China鈥檚 GDP recorded an annual growth of 3.2 percent inQ2, representing a rebound of 10 percentage points from Q1, which was muchhigher than expected. Looking beyond the near term, the fundamentals of steadyeconomic growth in the long run and high-quality development remainunchanged. The Chinese economy has demonstrated strong resilience. With pandemiccontainment measures remaining in place, economic and social activities havebasically returned to normal, thereby accelerating economic growth andrecovery. Currently, the pandemic containment and economic recovery in China isamong the fastest in the world, and the economic conditions have evolved from鈥渋nflicted supply and demand鈥  by the pandemic in Q1 to 鈥渞apidly recovering supplyand gradually improving demand鈥  in Q2. Market expectations are generally stable, and the economy is likely to resume its potential growth level in H2 2020. China鈥檚development is still and will continue to be for a long time at an important stage ofstrategic opportunities. The recent years have seen solid progress in fighting the鈥渢hree tough battles鈥  against major risks, poverty and pollution, along with deepenedsupply-side structural reforms, generally stable labor market conditions, steadygrowth of personal income, and continuous improvement in people鈥檚 livelihood. Newinfrastructure and new urbanization initiatives as well as major projects, such astransportation and water infrastructure, have been vigorously carried out, and newindustries, business models and growth drivers are taking shape and rapidlydeveloping. The proactive fiscal policy has been more impactful and the soundmonetary policy has been more flexible and appropriate. The financial sector hascontinuously enhanced its support for the real economy, especially for micro andsmall businesses (MSBs) and private enterprises. With prudent and decisive measuresto prevent and control financial risks, the financial system has been generally soundand capable of defusing various risks. The RMB exchange rate has been basicallystable at an adaptive and equilibrium level, and the economy has strengthened itscapability to address external shocks. The world economy has fallen into a recession, and the domestic economy stillfaces many challenges. The global pandemic remains in a prolonged plateau phase, geopolitical tensions have started to rise, and trade frictions between some countriesare intensifying, causing major instabilities and uncertainties. According to forecastsby the IMF and the World Bank, the global economy will contract by 4.9 percent or5.2 percent in 2020. The World Bank projects that the global economy may sink intothe worst recession since World War II. As pressures are still great in terms ofimported pandemic case prevention and world economic risks, and the pandemic stillhas an impact on domestic economic conditions, the service sector, including catering, tourism and cultural entertainment, is facing a relatively slow recovery. To offset theimpact of the pandemic, countercyclical adjustments in H1 have increased, and themacro leverage ratio has revealed a temporary rise. But with the economic growthresuming its potential levels, the macro leverage ratio will gradually return toreasonable levels. With regard to structural, institutional and cyclical concerns in theeconomy, as well as prominent issues of uneven development and underdevelopment, it is necessary to take an objective and rational perspective, to remain confident andfocused and to enhance opportunity and risk awareness. The PBC will manage its ownaffairs well by combining reforms and macro-management and accommodating bothshort-term and long-term considerations as well as internal and external equilibria, soas to build an economy that is more competitive, innovative and risk-proof. The PBCwill firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, vigorouslyprotect and stimulate the vitality of market entities, and ensure solid implementationof tasks regarding economic and social development. Consumer prices exhibit a smaller overall increase, and there are no grounds forpersistent inflation or deflation. The CPI鈥檚 year-on-year increase of above 5 percentat the beginning of 2020 was mainly due to the rapid rise in pork prices, added by theimpact of the pandemic on supply, and therefore possessed both structural andtime-specific characteristics. With multiple measures taken by governmentdepartments to guarantee supply and stabilize prices, monetary policy remained soundand the price increase steadily dropped to below 3 percent since February. Accordingto preliminary estimates, the average growth of the CPI in 2020 will fall into areasonable range. In addition, various commodity prices recovered to varying degreesin Q2. The PPI鈥檚 month-on-month growth turned positive, and the year-on-yeargrowth drop narrowed, which reflected the rebound in demand. However, the recentfloods in some provinces may affect the manufacture and transportation ofagricultural products, and the rapid increase in money supply in the advancedeconomies may push up commodity prices in the future. Furthermore, as the globalpandemic unfolds, in light of the uncertain impact of containment measures on supplychains and industry chains, it is necessary to pay close attention to the short-termprice fluctuations caused by various factors. From medium and long-termperspectives, China鈥檚 economic performance is generally stable, aggregate supply anddemand are basically in equilibrium, the supply-side structural reforms are being further carried out, the market mechanism is playing a better role, monetary policiesremain sound, and monetary conditions are reasonable and adequate, providing nogrounds for persistent inflation or deflation. II. Outlook for monetary policy in the next stageUnder the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristicsfor a New Era, the PBC will resolutely implement the decisions and arrangements ofthe CPC Central Committee and the State Council, remain committed to achieving thetarget of completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and coordinate pandemic containment with economic and social development. Withpandemic response measures kept in place, the PBC will adhere to the guidingprinciple of pursuing progress while ensuring stability and will uphold the newdevelopment philosophy. Solid efforts will be made to ensure stability on six fronts, namely, employment, the financial sector, foreign trade, foreign investment, domesticinvestment, and expectations, and to fully implement the tasks of maintaining securityin six areas, namely, employment, people's basic livelihoods, operations of marketentities, food and energy security, stable industrial and supply chains, and the normalfunctioning of primary-level governments, with the aim of achieving a decisivevictory in the tough battle against poverty and completing the building of amoderately prosperous society in all respects. The PBC will pursue a sound monetarypolicy that is more flexible, appropriate, and targeted, maintain the rational growth ofmoney supply and aggregate financing to the real economy (AFRE), and improvecross-cyclical policy design and adjustments. The relationship among stabilizinggrowth, safeguarding employment, adjusting the structure, preventing risks, andcontrolling inflation will be properly handled to achieve a long-term balance betweenstabilizing growth and preventing risks. The PBC will take measures in a moretargeted and timely way to manage the intensity, pace, and focus of monetary policyoperations in line with pandemic containment as well as economic and financialsituations. It will continue to attach higher priority to supporting the recovery of thereal economy and its sustainable development by using and launching a mix ofmonetary tools to keep liquidity adequate at a reasonable level and to smooth themechanism of monetary policy transmission. While the role of structural monetarypolicy tools in ensuring targeted liquidity provision will be effectively brought intoplay, efforts will be made to enable policy measures to provide more direct support forthe real economy, so as to help the real economy, particularly micro, small, andmedium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), pull through the difficulties and achieve stabledevelopment. Work will be done to guide expectations through multiple channels andkeep prices basically stable. Moreover, the PBC will deepen financial supply-sidestructural reforms, help foster a virtuous cycle and triangular interactions among thefinancial sector, the sci-tech sector, and industries, coordinate RMB and foreignexchange policies, and properly balance internal and external economic dynamics, sothat a new development pattern will be formed at a faster pace, where domestic and international circulations boost each other, with domestic circulation as the mainstay. First, the PBC will pursue a sound monetary policy that is more flexible, appropriate, and targeted. Based on the status of pandemic control and economicdevelopment, it will employ a mix of monetary policy tools to keep liquidity adequateat a reasonable level, guide the stable movement of market rates around open marketoperation rates and medium-term lending facility rates, and maintain the rationalgrowth of money supply and AFRE. Work will be done to match credit supply withthe financing needs of market entities, channel the stable flow of funds to the realeconomy, and support the economy to return to its potential growth rate. The capitalreplenishment mechanism will be improved to be sustainable so that banks will bebetter able to serve the real economy and to forestall and defuse financial risks. Byreducing overall financing costs, extending loans at preferential rates, and adoptingpolicies such as deferring principal and interest repayments for MSME loans, the PBCwill encourage the financial system to give up a reasonable part of its profits toenterprises. Additionally, the PBC will strengthen the synergy with the fiscal sector tofacilitate the issuance of government bonds and will join efforts with employment, industry, investment, and consumption policies. Second, to stabilize businesses and secure employment, the PBC will activelyexplore the propelling force of central bank lending and central bank discountsas well as the monetary policy tools that provide direct support for the realeconomy. Continued efforts will be made to effectively implement the central banklending and central bank discount policy with a quota of RMB1 trillion. After windingup the RMB300 billion of special central bank lending and the RMB500 billion ofcentral bank lending and central bank discount quotas, the PBC will maintain policystability by providing inclusive and sustained financing support for agro-linkedenterprises, MSBs, private enterprises, and industries severely affected by thepandemic. Active steps will be taken to promote the two monetary policy tools thatprovide direct support for the real economy and to guide locally incorporated financialinstitutions to step up credit support for inclusive MSBs that keep their employmentbasically stable, so as to ensure that targeted adjustments will be more effective inserving the purpose of stabilizing businesses and securing employment. The supporttool for the deferral of inclusive MSB loan repayments will be used to substantiallyease the pressures on MSBs caused by principal and interest repayments and to tidethem over the difficulties. The support scheme for unsecured inclusive MSB loanswill be used to address the lack of collaterals and guaranties for MSBs and to increasethe share of unsecured MSB loans in a move to ease their financing strains. Third, the PBC will give play to the role of monetary and credit policies inpromoting economic structural adjustments so as to better serve the real economy. The required reserve policy framework featuring 鈥渢hree tranches and twopreferential treatments鈥  will be further enhanced so that a long-term mechanism ofincreasing bank loans to MSBs will be put in place and improved. By balancingshort-term and long-term goals and adopting a combination of policies, the PBC willpush forward with the project of enhancing the capacity of commercial banks toprovide financial services for MSMEs, and it will also take steps to improve thebanks鈥  internal credit resource allocations as well as assessments and incentives. Research will be conducted on the linkup between financial support for povertyeradication and rural revitalization policies to consolidate the achievements made inthe battle against poverty. Work will be accelerated to roll out measures for theassessment of commercial banks鈥  services for rural revitalization so as to guide theflow of financial resources accordingly. Measures will be taken to facilitateconnections between banks and manufacturing enterprises in a move to ramp upmedium and long-term financing support for the manufacturing sector. Firmlyadhering to the principle that housing is for living in, not for speculation, and that thereal estate market shall not be used to provide a short-term stimulus to the economy, as well as remaining committed to stabilizing land prices, housing prices as well asexpectations, the PBC will maintain the continuity, consistency, and stability of realestate finance policies, and effectively implement the rules on prudential managementof real estate finance. Fourth, the PBC will deepen the market-oriented interest rate reform andexchange rate reform to increase the efficiency of financial resource allocations. The loan prime rate (LPR) reform will move ahead. In line with market-oriented andlaw-based principles, the PBC will basically complete the shift in the pricingbenchmark for outstanding floating-rate loans by the end of August so as to smooththe transmission mechanism of monetary policy and further bring down overallfinancing costs by means of reform. It will make effective use of the self-regulatorymechanism for market rate pricing, regulate deposit rate pricing conduct, maintain thefairness of pricing, and urge financial institutions to strictly implement therequirement for explicit indications of annualized loan rates so as to protect the rightsand interests of consumers. Taking steps to deepen the market-oriented exchange ratereform, the PBC will improve the managed floating exchange rate regime based onmarket supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, maintain theflexibility of the RMB exchange rate, and explore the role of the exchange rate inmacroeconomic management and as an automatic stabilizer for the balance ofpayments. Work will be done to stabilize market expectations and to keep the RMBexchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level. Steps will beaccelerated to develop the foreign exchange market and to provide services ofexchange rate risk management for import and export companies with authentic needs. Enterprises will be guided to be risk neutral in financial management and to manageexchange rate risks with foreign exchange derivatives. The PBC will steadily advancethe convertibility of the RMB under the capital account, improve the policy framework and the infrastructure for cross-border use of the RMB, and promote freeuse of the RMB in cross-border trade and investment. Fifth, the PBC will improve the financial market system and enable financialmarkets to play an effective role in stabilizing growth, promoting structuraladjustments, advancing reform, and guarding against risks. More efforts will bemade to build a market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized bond market and toenhance the capacity of the bond market to serve the real economy throughinnovations driven by development. Measures will be taken to strengthen institutionbuilding by improving the bond market management system and pushing for theunification of standards so as to improve bond market efficiency. Support will beprovided for bond financing by private enterprises. The mechanism of bond defaultrisk prevention and resolution will be improved in line with market-oriented andlaw-based principles. The PBC will enhance regulatory coordination andinterconnectivity between financial market infrastructures, and push forward with thebuilding of custodian banks and trade repositories to ensure that financial markets aregenerally stable while performing safely and efficiently. Active but prudent steps willbe taken to promote the institutional and systemic opening-up of the bond market andto introduce more medium and long-term investors into the market. Sixth, the PBC will deepen financial supply-side structural reforms and improvethe modern financial system to make it highly adaptable, competitive, andinclusive. Reforms of financial institutions will be further pushed ahead. Work willcontinue to be done to deepen the reform of development financial institutions andpolicy financial institutions by setting strict boundaries for their businesses andstrengthening prudential supervision so that development finance and policy financecan fully play their role in supporting economic structural transformation andhigh-quality economic development. Focusing on strengthening the mechanisms ofcorporate governance, reforms of commercial banks and other financial enterpriseswill go deeper continuously so as to regulate the relationship between the generalmeeting of shareholders, the board of directors, the board of supervisors, andmanagement, and to improve authorized management, thereby giving rise to effectivedecision-making, implementation as well as checks and balances, and enhancing theirbusiness management and risk control capabilities. Seventh, the PBC will make continued efforts to fight the tough battle offorestalling and defusing major financial risks so as to ensure that risks aregenerally controllable and steadily subsiding, and to firmly defend the bottomline that no systemic risk should occur. While consolidating the success alreadyachieved, the PBC will adhere to the fundamental principles of maintaining overallstability, taking a coordinated approach, adopting differentiated measures, and defusing bombs with precision. It will consider new developments in themacroeconomic situation from a holistic perspective and properly handle therelationship between fighting the pandemic, reviving the economy, and preventingand controlling risks, while acting prudently to defuse risks and firmly defending thebottom line that no systemic risk should occur. Moreover, the PBC will support banks, particularly small and medium-sized banks, to replenish capital through multiplechannels and to improve their governance, and will resolve non-performing loans withmore efforts so as to enhance the soundness of financial institutions.
